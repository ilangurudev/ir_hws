    "# Homework 1:  Basic Machine Learning + Learning to Rank \n",
    "\n",
    "### 100 points [5% of your final grade]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Due: Monday, February 12 by 11:59pm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Goals of this homework:* In this homework you will get hands-on experience with (i) the basics of machine learning (e.g. train/test data, cross-validation, different classifiers) and interpreting results; and (ii) learning to rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Submission Instructions:* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as UIN_hw#.ipynb. For example, this homework submission would be: YourUIN_hw1.ipynb. Submit this notebook via ecampus. Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Late submission policy:* For this homework, you may use up to three of your late days, meaning that no submissions will be accepted after Thursday, February 15 at 11:59pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration policy:* You are expected to complete each homework independently. Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. You may post on Piazza, search StackOverflow, etc. But if you do get help in this way, you must inform us by **filling out the Collaboration Declarations at the bottom of this notebook**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: I found helpful code on stackoverflow at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11764539/writing-fizzbuzz that helped me solve Problem 2.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA."

Do not remove stopwords. You should apply casefolding (lower case everything) and use the [nltk Porter stemmer](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.stem.html#module-nltk.stem.porter) ... you may need to install nltk if you don't have it already.

       "[u\"dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank.\",\n",
       " u\"unfortunately, the frustration of being dr. goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience i've had with so many other doctors in nyc -- good doctor, terrible staff.  it seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  it usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  i have run into this problem with many other doctors and i just don't get it.  you have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  it's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  it's with regret that i feel that i have to give dr. goldberg 2 stars.\",\n",
       " u\"dr. goldberg has been my doctor for years and i like him.  i've found his office to be fairly efficient.  today i actually got to see the doctor a few minutes early!  \\n\\nhe seems very engaged with his patients and his demeanor is friendly, yet authoritative.    \\n\\ni'm glad to have dr. goldberg as my doctor.\",\n",
       " u\"been going to dr. goldberg for over 10 years. i think i was one of his 1st patients when he started at mhmg. he's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. it is because of him, not my now former gyn dr. markoff, that i found out i have fibroids. he explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. he doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.\",\n",
       " u'got a letter in the mail last week that said dr. goldberg is moving to arizona to take a new position there in june.  he will be missed very much.  \\n\\ni think finding a new doctor in nyc that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!',\n",
       " u\"i don't know what dr. goldberg was like before  moving to arizona, but let me tell you, stay away from this doctor and this office. i was going to dr. johnson before he left and goldberg took over when johnson left. he is not a caring doctor. he is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. he will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. and to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that no one ever answers or returns your call. both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. the entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. give me a break! stay away from this doc and the practice. you deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. i have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until i met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",
       " u\"top notch doctor in a top notch practice. can't say i am surprised when i was referred to him by another doctor who i think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \\nit is really easy to get an appointment. there is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.\",\n",
       " u'dr. eric goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and i have had. unlike many of my past doctors, dr. goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. we are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come.',\n",

       " u\"one of my favorite truck stop diners with solid food and friendly, quick service. my god, those desserts are huge! i can't imagine eating that giant cream puff. \\nall the food we had was delicious and i love how they leave a carafe of coffee on the table. love this place. would definitely be back if i was in the area!\",\n",
       " u\"only went here once about a year and a half ago, but they had great pancakes! my only problem with it at the time was that they allowed smoking, so i left smelling like a cigarette. with the change in law, i'm sure the atmosphere has improved!\",\n",
       " u'great truck stop restaurant.  i\\'ve had breakfast and dinner here and it has always been good.  huge portions and reasonable prices.  the bakery i guess is legendary.  they have doughnuts the size of your head!  eclairs the size of your arm and cream puffs that are about 10\" high.  on our most recent trip in the area, stopped at the gas station attached to the restaurant fo some quick snacks and of course bakery.\\n\\nif you are driving by and see the sign for the pine cone restaurant - take the next off ramp and stop it.',\n",
       " u\"yeah, thats right a five freakin star rating.  \\n\\nfive star truck stop dining at its finest.\\n\\nbe prepared to eat.  \\n\\ni was first introduced to the pine cone at its johnson creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts.   then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the pine cone, i thought is there really more than one?  i looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near johnson creek -- when we arrived, and i saw the bakery....i knew i was home.\\n\\nit was near dinner time so i ordered stuffed chicken breast.  the dinner roll alone is a meal.  i can't say enough about dinner.  everything is homemade. they don't add alot of salt, if any.  you can tell its fresh.  its plentiful.  its cheap.  you literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.\\n\\nyou can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, if they can make it home.  in our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  the last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the pine cone.\",\n",
       " u'ate a saturday morning breakfast at the pine cone.  friendly,quick service, normal prices.  but for the new year - the special was all-you-can-eat pancakes for $2.12, i added a breakfast sausage patty ($3.00).  father had the typical, two eggs, toast, hash-bowns (seem fresh cut), sausage links.  food was tasty, no major qualms other than - the hash-browns need a bit more cooking and the coffee needs a bit more bite.\\n\\nvery nice assortment of bakes goods - massive - as large as your head cream-puffs, eclairs - i took a blueberry muffin to go - which i enjoyed.  \\n\\nquick exit from i-94...just northeast of  madison',\n",
       " u\"attention fans of david lynch.  do stop by this place.  the atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable.\\nlast time i was here i ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll.  the waitress asked if i wanted it warmed with some butter.   i thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that.  she nodded agreement.  then when she brought it to me it was unheated and no butter.   odd but also kind of humorous.  i always enjoy being in a david lynch film from time to time.\\nthe service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51.  be sure to go here instead.   their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s.   take a table.  start a conversations with the truck driver to your left. \\nwe used to go to the pine cone when it was across the street.  must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street.   that place now sits empty.   why is this area depressed?   don't ask me, i don't know.  do i look like i have all the answers?\\nthe food here is good and the prices are cheap.   go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery.  or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods.    well worth the stop.\\nthis place gets four stars because of their five star bakery selection.  crazy big cinnamon rolls and good prices.\",\n",
       " u'i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it\\'s pretty perfect.  i\\'ve only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  the hashbrowns are the best i\\'ve had in a long time - perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  the pancakes are huge and light and amazing.  the cinnamon rolls taste just as good as they look.\\n\\nprices are right on, baked goods are pretty great.  service is fast and friendly - really fast.  i haven\\'t had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal.  i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  it shouldn\\'t be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is.  sure it\\'s a \"greasy spoon\" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  can\\'t recommend this place enough for great breakfasts.',\n",
       " u\"with a recent addition of a truck driver for a bf i have found myself frequenting truck stops to dine. this little place is quite a pleasant surprise. basically it is just great home cooking. everything is homemade and quite good. the baked goods in the front counter were amazing. the size of the cinnamon rolls was insane. and of course i couldn't leave without a piece of pie.\",\n",
       " u'this is one of the best breakfasts i have had! is the decor dated? absolutely but it just adds to the nostalgic charm! the place just reeks of beef cooking... ahhh delicious! check out the pastry cases!!!! omg, is all i have to say!',\n",
       " u'hands down one of the best breakfasts my wife and i have had. stopped in here based on the positive reviews from fellow yelpers and was sure glad i did. \\n\\nthis is a good sized diner at a truck stop. the first thing that caught our eye was the pastries - they were all huge and all looked great. tip - be sure to save space for at least one. \\n\\ni went with the cinnamon roll french toast and was very pleased. very large portion and great taste - go witht the sausage patty over the links. people behind us had links on their plate and they didnt look too appetzing. the patty was good. \\n\\nwife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns. hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh. \\n\\noverall, great experience and we were in and out in 35 mins so we could continue out journey. looking forward to stopping here again sometime soon.',\n",
       " u'this is definitely not your usual truck stop. pastries look delicious. dinner rolls are large enough for a meal themselves and good!  we had a young waitress who i think was new. we found her to be sweet, polite and trying very hard. the lady managing the restaurant was really rude to her. we could all hear it.',\n",
       " u'a delicious breakfast.  amazing fresh bakery and pastry items.  however, the parkinglot/gas station area is filthy.  strewn with debris, dead cars, broken glass.  if you judge a book by this cover you would never venture inside.  i hope the mgr.  sees this and cleans up.',\n",
       " u\"don't be fooled because it's in a truck stop, truckers know where there are good places to eat. stop here just for the desserts, i bought an eclair that must have weighed a pound, delicious, like they are supposed to be made. cream puffs look like they wouldn't fit in a one pound coffee can... grin. don't miss this place...\",\n",
       " u\"continuing on my saturday morning hangover theme: there's just something about a plateful of greasy food when you're slightly hung over that makes it all better. the pine cone has down-home, rib-sticking, greasy food in spades.  the so and i split the chicken fried steak, which comes with plenty of toast, hashbrowns, and two eggs.  i could'nt finish mine!  the gravy must be the same that they use for biscuits and gravy, because it tasted sausage-y, and as my plate sat there i could see the grease rising to the top.  but--i didn't come here in search of health food, and it was just what the doctor ordered. i'll work out later.\",\n",
       " u\"some times jane and michael stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food.  i would definitely return to the pine cone.  it's a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the wisconsin highway.  i live in chicago and work in a famous mexican restaurant and i get up to wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible: it gives me the energy to do my job.  pine cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat.  and i got a pig cookie.  this little truck stop gives me the big energy to get even deeper into steak and butter territory.\",\n",
       " u\"i like this location better than the one near johnson's creek.  it is a bit tight when you walk in, but the charm soon takes over.  \\n\\ni was not really impressed by the food.  however, their pastries won my over.  try it all!  the pie was delicious.  i went with a simple apple selection.  delicious, perfection.  it is nothing crazy, no fancy name but truthfully one of the best piece of classic apple you can find around here.  \\n\\nthe service is a little slow but once again, it is a small restaurant with lots of charm.  you get what you get and i love it.  it is near a christmas tree farm so it is the perfect place to stop and get some cocoa on your way.\",\n",
       " u'this place was excellent. we were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly.',\n",
       " u\"omg!  the bakery items at pinecone are amazing!   cinnamon rolls as big as your head and absolutely scrumptious!   the food in the restaurant is great for truck stop food.  we've only come for breakfast but stop every single time we head up to rhinelander,  wi.  do not miss this place if even only for their baked goods!\",\n",
       " u\"a really lovely surprise on a rather horrific family road trip.\\n\\nwe were greeted at the door, the waitress was a peach, and the nice man who filled water/helped out was the sweetest guy ever. the food is also great if you're a fan of the diner-type grub; my hot turkey sandwich will live on in my dreams.\\n\\nyou can definitely tell the place has the old time appeal of a great family place as all the locals (mostly older people) know each other and it's clear it's the happening place for breakfast with the over-60 crowd (but hey, that says the food has to be pretty homestyle and tasty to me.)  \\n\\nif you're headed down 94 and need a good lunch stop, make this it.\",\n",

       " u\"unlimited hot coffee. i don't have any recollection of what i ate....\\n\\ni wanted t give it four stars, but that would be a very generous review for a meal i cannot recall.\\n\\ni know it was decently good, and it's like the only restaurant in deforest.\\n\\nfor that, i give it four stars.\",\n",
       " u\"homestyle cooking at its best, dnt go to culvers, mcdonald's or whatever trash is right off the hwy, head a bit further down u will find this gem, one of the reasons i love this place so much? they dnt play annoying music, scratch that, they don't play any music. people working here are super nice as to be expected. if i owned this joint, i would invest in a new bigger sign, as i drove right by this place and almost missed it twice.\",\n",

       " u'went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try.\\n\\nyikes! how can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best \"average\", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn\\'t rate two stars.\\n\\ni had one of the special friday offerings, smelt. it came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the smelt. after a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. i looked at my plate and was shocked! there was 12-15 so-called smelt about 3\" long and deep fried. they looked like little fat cigarettes! i bit into one and it was all batter, i tried another and it was the same. i had deep fried batter for lunch!!\\ni haven\\'t had a meal this bad since i got out of the navy! \\n\\n my co-workes meals were not much better, one had chicken fried steak and he said it was made out of the box. my other co-worker had the cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! yuk! \\n\\ni hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned \"one\" star. maybe they have great breakfast! i hope they do because their lunches are sub-par. \\n\\nthere are other restaurants on this street/highway, i\\'d give them a try before i stopped here. i know my co-workers and i won\\'t be coming back.',\n",
       " u\"don't have time and/or cute outfits for madison but want an alternative to cracker barrel? this is your stop. i started with the chicken dumpling soup. simply divine, so much as to seriously tempt my veg accomplice. cheese curds were another hit, far superior to those from the state fair.  wraps, sammys, even the fried mushrooms were consistent, wholesome, and fresh. service was on point, our waitress brianna was business pro.  people watching was a little poor(s), to be expected in rural midwest? i think our impassioned debate over drug use might have startled the crowd.\\n\\nnonetheless, not a cracker barrel. takes amex.\",\n",
       " u'huge menu, fresh tasty food, reasonable prices.  beats a chain highway place for sure. the chicken dumpling soup alone is worth a trip (fresh made every day and it caused my vegetable-phobic daughter to eat carrots and celery of her own voltion!);  the steak-cut french fries were great and the coconut cream pie was wonderful.',\n",

       " u\"really good stuff!! the custard was great! i loved it and when i am back in the old usa i can only hope i will cross paths with another culvers.\\n\\nyou know what the thing is with culvers? you actually don't need that much, it's sort of like eating cake batter or cookie dough. you can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic spoon around and staring down the custard and wondering why you dont wanna finish. yeah it's custard and it's heavy especially when you add every kind of peanut butter chocholate bar to the mix.let me tell you those first five spoonfuls are pure goodness then it goes downhill. less is more with this stuff let me tell you! next time i am getting the smallest size, and i will be far more pleased and not guilty i threw out a mega size bucket. hahaha!\",\n",
       " u\"my meaty goodness...why isn't culvers a nationwide chain?  this bacon cheese burger is way too good to come out of a fastfood drive through window.  i had a nice little picnic on the tailgate of my pickup (driving cross country....long story).  i could not believe how great this burger was. \\n\\nthe amazing part is the onion rings might be better than the burger.\\n\\nif you're passing through wisconsin, you need to stop at culvers.\",\n",

       " u\"the green lantern is the kind of place that comes in right above the mendoza line.  what i mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  i'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the green lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  however there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that i've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a friday night.  the green lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.\\n\\nmy friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  as such i've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  there are quite a few pluses.  the bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including ale asylum offerings.  i love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  the service has always been above average and i can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  they've got wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and american cheese.  and finally the green lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of mcfarland.  i don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.\\n\\nthe negatives: first and foremost i've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  i'm not big on fish fry, and the green lantern's friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  now as i said, i'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that i have ordered the fish i've been underwhelmed.  this is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  there's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  while i've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, i have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  that is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  \\n\\nif it were just up to me i don't think i'd be going to the green lantern all that much.  after all, i don't live in mcfarland and i don't really go for supper club fish fries.  but so long as i know people that love going here i'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  i think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the green lantern.\",\n",

       " u\"the man and i are on this thing now where we are trying to eat at a few places famous for their fish fry's thanks to an article in madison magazine.  there are a few places in the mag that i am looking forward to trying but green lantern was the first one that we hit up.  \\n\\ndriving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what i was expecting and not looking forward to.  as we got closer however i realized how big this place was on the inside.  it's huge!   at least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  i'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  i mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  on the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so i can't really complain.\\n\\nbecause we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  we started with the calamari which i'm starting to find out is not one of wisconsin's strong suits.  i don't think i have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'the great calamari showdown'!  anyway, i had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  \\n\\ni ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  the man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  the fish was pretty good.  it was juicy and fresh and not bad.  i thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  i think i would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  with that said however i though it was alright.  the man on the other hand was in love.  he likened his enjoyment of this place to the tornado room.  pure blasphemy.  he clearly doesn't know anything about food. \\n\\nall in all i am glad i tried this place but i don't think i will be making it a regular haunt.\",\n",
       " u\"stopped in for a dinner after getting a recommendation from a co worker and we were very impressed!  it was fairly quiet on a thursday night - no problem getting a table.  the location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  the ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.\\n\\ngreen lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!\\n\\ni had the ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  my wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  we are definitely coming back!\\n\\nthe server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  she also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  well done :)\\n\\nhint:  ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.\\nhint hint:  the location, ambiance, and setup is very family and kid friendly!  they were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!  very sweet....\",\n",
       " u\"been here a few times. once for breakfast and few times for drinks/apps. food has been very good and the service is decent. they don't have the best view of the lake but we'll still be back.\",\n",
       " u\"any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me.. it's packed on friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table, the wait is worth it... don't hesitate to try this place out you won't be disappointed..\",\n",

       " u'went last friday to try the famous fish fry.  arrived at 5:50pm and was quoted a 25-30 minute wait, which i found acceptable.  we were not called until 55 minutes later, and this only happened when i brought my two young sons and sat on the floor conspicuously in plain view of the host stand.  at that point we were offered the \"quick alternative\" of a table downstairs.  where was this option earlier?\\n\\nlook, we knew going out on the first friday of lent would result in a wait and we brought a myriad of distractions along to kill time for our 4 and 2 year olds.  those wear thin, however, when the wait is double what you are initially told and have subsequently relayed to the kids.  maybe this is all due to an inexperienced host.\\n\\nour server was very attentive and the food was good.  we tried the baked, beer-battered, and fried fish.  we also had baked potatoes and french fries as well as salads.  overall, this was not the best madison has to offer.  we may return, but would only due so as a just a couple or as a family if we could arrive before the rush.',\n",
       " u\"the lantern doesn't profess to be anything more than it is. good american, wisco supper club fare. prices are very good, and they know how to cook a steak to temperature. bloody mary's are great as they allow you to add your own seasonings to taste.  decent wine selection by the glass.  they even have sambuca. \\ntry the surf n turf. very good at a great price. \\nalso fried chicken. \\nsolid choice, and nicest place on lake waubesa.\",\n",
       " u\"we went to the green lantern last friday and it was our first visit there.several of our friends had always spoken highly of it so we thought we would give their friday fish fry a try. i had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.the bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed i was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.a few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.we were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.so far so good.we ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.the kalamari came first and it was ok. our drinks were finished so we ordered more.finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.so we reminded her again.my fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.my moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.the cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns i had ordered were good as well.my partners shrimp though was awful.it was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.the french fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.when we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which i really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.she did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.however, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.like i said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.next time we are going to tobys nearby instead.they consistently serve quality food along with good service.\",\n",
       " u\"i've been taking my adorable old english sheepdog here since i got him as a puppy over 6 yrs ago. the staff has always been great about getting me in for appointments even with short notice. the new clinic is very nice, always clean, and set up well. they willingly give you all the treatment options available and corresponding pricings, which always seem reasonable. my guy has had some issues over the years (hematoma on his ear that needed to be surgically drained) and the staff treated him super well and helped him recover quickly. i no longer live in mcfarland, but i still drive out there to keep going to this clinic.\",\n",
       " u\"spartan animal hospital is a fantastic place. i am a seriously poor college grad and i took my new cat (from the shelter) to spartan for her rabies and fvrcp booster shots today. i was really impressed with the staff and the facility. the people were extremely friendly and were patient and willing to answer all of my questions. they gave me a folder full of good information and the home phone number of dr. c, the owner, in case of non-office hour emergencies. that's dedication.\\n\\nthe best part about spartan is that they don't charge the regular office fee if you're just coming in for vaccinations! it's a rare thing to be pleasantly surprised at a cash register, isn't it?\\n\\ni highly recommend spartan to you!\",\n",
       " u\"what could i possibly say about the beach house restaurant and lounge?  i guess i could think of a few things.\\n\\ni went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods wisconsin eatery.  let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  what we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of chevy and dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  deal with it kids, this is that slice of midwest americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural america.  fish fry anyone?\\n\\nto begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the beach house's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in mcfarland.  i stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \\n\\ndo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  and man was this separate dining room packed (superbowl sunday).  packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  god bless america.\\n\\nthe am dish to get here is the walleye and eggs breakfast.  i would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  as breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\\n\\nso give it to me hard backwoods wisconsin.  give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody mary drinking, being.  just be.  and give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.  and don't you dare forget the tartar sauce.\",\n",
       " u'service was terrible! i will never return!!! we waited in the bar and were never greeted or spoken too. people walked in after us and were seated. not sure what their structure is for seating, but they suck at it. i will not be back.',\n",
       " u'this place is pretty dumpy - \"corinthian leather\" chairs, crappy tables...\\nwhat is worth going for is the walleye and eggs served on weekends.  it is a huge portion of walleye, lighty fried, served with eggs cooked to order, potatoes and toast.  all this for something like $10.  totally worth a side trip if you are in madison.',\n",
       " u\"amazing friday night fish fry! i got out a lot for fish fry's in madison and the surrounding area and this still remains my favorite. i usually get the cod dinner, which is always cooked perfect, not too soggy or too crispy, which comes with a side and a soup or salad for only $9.95. i always recommend the beach house when someone is looking for a great fish fry! :)\",\n",
       " u\"for being surrounded by two lakes, madison doesn't do a great job of having places to drink on the water. head down to mcfarland and check out the beach house. it's like a dive bar slash restaurant right on the lake. tons of windows. not a bad place.\\n\\ncan't comment on the food. drink specials were solid.\",\n",
       " u'this place has good steaks,and fish fry. i also like the saturday special bacon wrapped filet, with lobster tail,all for 24.99 i think? all the dinners come with soup or salad, potato choic,warm rolls w/ butter. walleye,cod,bluegill are all delecious. good place for a beer as well. great view, and drink specials. this is a real sconnie place,wisco to the core. my fave fish fry spot for sure.',\n",

       " u'i really wanted to like this place but it wasn\\'t what we were looking for.\\n\\nthey have a great spot on the lake but it is a pretty dumpy little fish shanty.   if that is what you are looking for, you will love it.  there were a bunch of locals there having a good time and if we were there with a group of our friends it might be ok for a few beers.  but still way way too crowded.  like sardines in a can.\\nthere was no one to greet us so we just took a table by the window.   then we waited and waited.  then someone came over and said hi.  then we waited and waited.  i was about to get up and leave when someone came over and said, \"oh, you haven\\'t been waited on yet?\"  so she then tried to help things along.   \\nthe menu was average for sandwiches but overpriced, we felt, for entrees as we ordered the ahi tuna and the bluegill.   the tuna was very good and perhaps appropriately priced but the bluegill was not proportionately enough.  it was made well enough and had ok flavor but should have been a few dollars less.\\nsalad was ok.  at least had a variety of greens but still needed a little more.\\nif i ever went back it would be for a few beers and the view, that\\'s it.\\nit\\'s too bad because we really need some nice places on the lake and with all the lakes around here there aren\\'t as many lakeside restaurants as you would expect.',\n",
       " u\"this is the quintessential mom and pop bar / restaurant on a lake. they specialize in cheap beer and great food. staff is friendly and down home, but you'd better leave your big-city attitude at home.\\n\\nwe went for a friday night fish fry. i live in seattle these days and was not about to miss the opportunity while in town.\\n\\nstarted with a couple of spotted cows (on tap!) while the rest drank miller lite. (told ya...) there were five adults plus a 12-year old.\\n\\nwalleye was excellent, the waitress was too. we made reservations and the table was ready well ahead of time. our one tactical error was sitting in the bar for the view. it was loud! think that the dining room is much quieter.\\n\\nnotice that i am not saying much about the food? here's the deal:\\n- it was friday\\n- it was hot\\n- the beer was cold\\n- the fish fry was exactly what you would expect in a place like this: great walleye!\\n\\n'nough said...\",\n",

       " u'now i must state one little thing about the way i rate restaurants. my ratings are relative to my expectations of the experience and in no way relative to other restaurants, (it just isn\\'t fair to use the same scale for a place like the beach house as you would for the french laundry so again, it\\'s all relative) \\n\\ni\\'ve only been here for breakfast but the second time i drove a long damn way to have breakfast again so that in and of it self should say something. (another caveat: there are maybe six restaurants in mcfarland that don\\'t have drive-thrus)  \\n\\ni ordered the walleye and eggs both times along with a bloody mary (gotta love a beer back, yay for wisconsin). now i am well aware of the number of bones that a whole walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the beach house responsible for that. i can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus i think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can\\'t get fish for breakfast at these prices in chicago) \\n\\nfor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\\n\\nto sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o\\' the dog\" in mcfarland wisconsin because \"what happens at the beach house, stays at the beach house\" and we all love that about any restaurant.',\n",
       " u'i use to boat in this area alot.  i always made this place to stop for  breakfast. very good.   they are know for there walleys and eggs,  some people even like a bloody mary or vodka and orange served with them.  anything on the menu is good.  nice place on the water.  you can come by boat or car.  if you come by boat a nice little ride over to madison area makes it a fun day.',\n",
       " u'we love the beach house.  we come here often.  food is always good.  drinks are made by some really awesome people!  specials are always worth a look. weekend breakfasts are very popular, so come early.  try the walleye/eggs.  or the crab/eggs benedict.  very very good!!',\n",

       " u\"i got a groupon for here for my fiancee and mine's anniversary, and we finally were able to get there a month later.  the restaurant was super easy to find and i loved how it was right on the lake.  i spent a lot of time the last few summers in northern wi on a lake, so it was nice to be back on a lake again- brought back good memories!  we did not make a reservation, so it was an hour wait for a table when we arrived.  we hung out in the slightly crowded bar and had a few drinks while we were waiting.  the drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  we were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  they had lots of specials going on that night (friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  delish!  they had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  i got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the caribbean salmon.  i know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  i got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  the salmon with the caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!  our server was attentive all night, even though the restaurant was super busy all night.  by the time we left, i was very full and satisfied.\",\n",
       " u\"went here for fish fry with one of my friends and we ended up sitting outside and watching the sunset. our server was very nice and the food was soooo good! i had the fried cod and she had the walleye. we were both impressed and full after the meal. my favorite part - the price - very affordable and you get to pick your sides, which were also really good, american fries and asparagus. i'd highly recommend and i'm going back!\",\n",
       " u'stopped here while on a sunday drive.  tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed.  she was rude and careless.  we walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better.  unfortunately the same lady came in and started venting about her customers.  seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore.  too bad because the beer was nice and cold.  great views too.',\n",
       " u\"it was ok - waitress was very good - even with 7:45 friday night reservations no tables were available and had a very long wait - drunk patron at the bar swearing very loud with the f-bomb and other words and slamming items on the bar - first ordered the salmon special and of course it was already sold out - two of us then ordered the fish fry mine was lukewarm and the other one was cold. don't plan on going back.\",\n",
       " u\"i took my mom and grandma to the beach house last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a papa murphy's pizza. there weren't many patrons in the dining room. our waitress was very short with us, demanding our drink orders before taking any questions or orders for our food. i ordered scallops, and when they came to the table they were overcooked, but also cold. it took me at least 15 minutes to find the waitress to ask if i could get warmer food. she said that she would have the kitchen make up a new meal, and about 15 minutes later she returned with my same plate, with my original fork and original food. they scallops were now warm, but lacked flavor, and were even tougher than before. the waitress didn't seem to care about the quality of the food and seemed to be either having a terrible night or was on the influence of something. needless to say, i will not be returning. on a positive note, the sunset on the lake is pretty.\",\n",
       " u'later in the night, not very crowded yet they insisted we sit crowded next to another pair of people.  service was slow, just getting a drink was an effort.  food was poorly prepared and over cooked, or as in my partners case cold.  no way coming back other than drinks in the summer.',\n",
       " u'we found this place on a groupon deal and were excited to try a new place. it was a train wreck! the dining area was not very busy even tho it was a friday night fish fry. that should have been our first clue. we ordered the steak and lobster, the steak was very good, but the lobster was still raw. we sent it back to be re warmed, and still returned undercooked. we decided to take it \"to go\" and finish cooking it at home.my husband and i love our bloody marys & this is not the place to order one. blah. needless to say, we will not be back, nor recommend this place to anyone else.',\n",

       " u\"i am a huge believer in bed & breakfasts, especially in the winter when you are bound to spend more time indoors.  this is a very cute one; bf and i stayed here on our visit to madison.  hosts were very friendly, so we started our (very big) breakfasts around 9 and usually ended around 10.  they were very accommodating and solicitous of our feedback.  \\n\\nwe stayed in the mentor room, which was spacious and had a hot tub but no shower, so i used the shared shower across the hall since there weren't many guests during that weekend.  it really felt like we were staying at a friend's house, except i didn't need to help with the dishes.\\n\\nsome things that didn't bother me but might other people:\\n1)  note that they have two large dogs\\n2)  if you're averse to flowered wallpaper, this is not the place for you.\",\n",
       " u\"goodbye hotels!  after this cozy little place i'm a bed and breakfast faithful.  \\n\\nour host, craig, was wonderful.  it was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  the place itself gave me the same joy i remember having when i would go see grandparents as a child.  that feeling of a warm house.  oh, did i mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  \\n\\nthe bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  we stayed in the sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  they offered a small bookshelf of books and madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  the sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (i think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  this was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  \\n\\nfor the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche i've ever had.  pardon my french! my fiance is a vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  he also had a myriad of drink options.  some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  it was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  then it was baked.  then it was devoured with great speed.  seriously, this was heavenly.  also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. \\n\\ncraig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  he is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  \\n\\nmy fiance and i are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.  i could't recommend this place enough.\",\n",
       " u\"what a wonderful place craig runs! so happy we chose to stay at the parsonage for a girls weekend to madison.\\n\\nthe highlights:\\n- location: while the b&b is about 25 minutes from downtown madison, it's very easy to get to. the perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. \\n- price: the three of us chose the top floor reverend's retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. it had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. for the friday & saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in madison.\\n- food: oh my goodness, can craig cook! the breakfasts alone would've been worth $20/person at a restaurant. definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. \\n- the company: on the weekend we were there, we (late 20s/early 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in madison. and, craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. \\n\\nif you're in town, definitely look up & consider the parsonage.\",\n",
       " u\"my 8 year old daughter and i stayed at the b&b this past weekend.  we stayed in the sorenson room which was the right size for us.  it had an attached, good sized bathroom which was great, and my daughter loved that she got to take a bath in a tub that was over 100 years old.  (the water pressure is great by the way).  there was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  the room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  he was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.  the price was very affordable, and the next time i'm in the area i'll be staying there instead of a hotel.  : )\",\n",
       " u\"loved staying here.  we were going up to madison for the day and found this place through a quick google search of madison-area b&b's.  craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when i called to inquire about prices and availability.  he was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (i'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  when we got to the parsonage, i was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in madison proper.  it was quiet and cozy.  we picked the mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   our bed was so comfortable, i think i actually miss it.  since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), i used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  breakfast the next day was so nice.  craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  there was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  the conversation was also really nice - i like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  great people and great company.  next time we are in the madison area, we will definitely stay here.  craig, thanks for all the hospitality!  from denise and justin\",\n",
       " u\"parsonage was a perfect fit for my recent trip. what it is: warm, quaint, charmingly old, affordable, homey, accommodating of diet. what it is not: posh, uber-modern, sleek, extravagant.\\nhas wifi. has a (very well-mannered & clean) dog. street parking. does not have private bathrooms for each room, so be sure to check on that when booking if it's important to you.\\n\\ncraig the owner and coriander the springer spaniel were a warm greeting party. craig went out of his way to make me feel comfortable with the house, the amenities, where to find him if i needed something, etc. i called him later that night after i realized i had accidentally left without a key, and he told me exactly where he would hide one outside for my return. it felt less like paid lodging, and more like staying with distant relatives. \\nour group had some gluten-sensitive members and some lactose-sensitive members, so craig made sure that each breakfast had options for everyone. one morning, the power went out around 5am before he could cook the breakfast casserole, so he ran down to a bakery and brought back an improvised meal of fruits and a kringle (?), a local specialty. the weather was nice, so we spent plenty of time on his newly renovated screened-in porch listening to music while we sipped coffee and rubbed coriander's belly.\",\n",

       " u'i was there on monday december 30, 2013.  and i will never be back again.  i waited nearly ten minutes for a person to show up at the counter.  i just wanted a lane and some shoes.  we were told to go to number 8.  when it was not on, we went back to the counter.  no one was there.  i waited another 5 minutes.  i then went into the bar where i found our person too busy to do his job because he was drinking.  from his vantage point he could not see if people were coming in.\\n\\nin addition to that, he kept pointing and telling me number 8 was on.  he could not see number 8 and was just aimlessly pointing.  most likely he was drunk.  \\n\\nspartan bowl, get some better staff.  perhaps ensure that your staff can stay sober.',\n",

       " u\"it's perhaps the closest you can get to authetic chinese food in a place like madison, particularly after china palace closed. the food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an american audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real. \\n\\nmy real problem with this place is the service: the menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish. i politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager. the manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!\\n\\nin the end, i paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but i will never visit this place again. i'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because i was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired.\",\n",
       " u\"this was, quite possibly, the worst chinese food (if you can call it that) that i've ever eaten in my life.\\n\\nwe started with the appetizer platter for two.  the calamari was so stringy that i had to swallow it in one bite because i couldn't separate it with my teeth.  the egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  the shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\\n\\nthen came the entrees.  i ordered imperial chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  i was wrong.  the breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\\n\\nmy boyfriend ordered the ma-po tofu.  he loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  the tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\\n\\napart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  i had to ask several times for a glass of water.  the waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  by this time, i drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  i tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \\n\\nplus, i thought it was supposed to be an authentic chinese food restaurant - what's with the vivaldi and mozart soundtrack?\\n\\nskip this place all together and hit up the asian grocery and gas station next door.  on fridays, they receive shipments of pork bao in from a bakery in chicago that are to die for!\",\n",

       " u'what a crushing experience.\\n my son was in town and when he is here we like to visit and spoil ourselves to a splurge of a dinner outing. this particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. so on this stormy night we decided on chinese and i had recommended we drive to middleton for what i had heard to be the best around.\\nok..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\\nafter the immediate seating, we were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\\n\\nappetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was horrible  btw  i could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\\n\\nmy forewarning is not to trust in ordering the lobster dish. i wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\\nmore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as market price. she said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. so that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. i thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\\nwhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. it was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. the meat was still in shell. (and i mean in shell).  there was hardly any meat to be had. the tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell intact and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  i was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.there was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. all in all an extreme disappointment. not what i was expecting in the least!!\\n\\nas the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. i will never return. i cannot tolerate being misled by a server\\n we ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. the storm raged on , i did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. not a total loss i guess.just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated.',\n",

       " u\"imperial garden has been getting progressively worse over the last few years. the waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. the restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. the ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\\n\\nbut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. that is, if you get your food at all. on more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when i've picked up take-out. i now double-check all of my orders before leaving. the egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. they are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. i've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. not spicy enough, and far too sour. i usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. there's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. if they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. i've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. on a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. it had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. it was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. the only reason i go here as often as i do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\\n\\ni did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy chinese food available in madison at comparable prices. if you're looking for good chinese in town, check out hong kong cafe on regent or orient house on south park instead.\",\n",

(mainly getting my oil changed). the facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. it is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a big screen tv, leather chairs, free wifi, and the best of all... free starbucks coffee. i have had nothing but great experiences from zimbrick and not just zimbrick acura. however, because of zimbrick acura i expect to buy another acura and stay with them for a very very long time. thank you zimbrick acura! you guys are the best of the best.\\n\\np.s. when i was having major service done they let me choose what i wanted to drive while i waited for the day.  nobody does that. so i had some fun with a brand new tl one day on a secret \"test\" road zimbrick european showed me when i was buying my car just off rimrock road.',\n",
       " u\"this is going to sound very weird:  i actually look forward to bringing my acura in for service here.  there.  i said it.  why? they are extremely efficient, and they manage to make me feel like a rockstar every time i go in.  now, i love my little acura--but having a fling with one of the brand spanking new, sporty little numbers they provide as loaners makes the whole experience feel adventurous and decadent.  even though i'm dropping lots of moulah on a brake job.  and i have to give the car back.\",\n",
       " u\"the outdoor sand volleyball courts are nice, and there is an outdoor bar area for spectators, celebrating a win, or drowning your sorrows after a loss.  there is also a playground right there which is nice for people that bring their kids along.  the outdoor soccer field looks nice, but they don't have a scoreboard, so you can't tell how much time is left in the game or keep track of the score.  the facility seems well kept, and the staff has been very nice.\\n\\nif you have a serious team and are competitive, keva is a great place to play sports.  if you are looking for something more laid back and social, there are plenty of nice bar leagues around which may be a better fit.\",\n",
       " u\"keva is a large sports complex with indoor and outdoor soccer, volleyball and basketball courts. it is hands down the nicest facility i've played volleyball at in the madison area. it would get more stars from me if it weren't for a few things: \\n\\n1. their leagues are much more expensive than others in the area (and the seasons are shorter as well). pooley's and mscr don't have the same facilities, but their seasons are longer.\\n\\n2. it's in the middle of nowhere. the location is only convenient if you live in middleton or on the far west side. driving there from anywhere else suuuucks, especially in the winter.\\n\\n3. it is always cold in there. if they're going to charge what they do for leagues, the least they could do is turn the heat up a bit, or do something with their insulation.\",\n",
       " u'my wife and i have played in the volleyball leagues (sand and indoor) and our kids do some of the kids programming.  facility is very nice and great atmosphere. instructors have all been really nice and referees do there best, but very nice. :) only reason i have it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the high costs. as someone else said in their review, it is more expensive and sessions are shorter. but overall,  very good.',\n",

       " u'only stayed two nights but would be very comfortable with a much longer stay.  we had a 2-bedroom suite and it was hu-uge!  two masters, i initially took the one closer to the front door before realizing i\\'d given the kids the king bed.  mommy don\\'t play that.  i made everyone switch.  three tvs.  two ironing boards and irons.  kitchenette.\\nthe layout and amenities was very much like a residence inn but maybe a (small) notch cheaper.\\nthe pool/hot tub was really nice.  indoors, clean and completely empty and open 24 hours!  who does that?  it\\'s completely separate from the other buildings, so we didn\\'t feel bad when we were having chicken fights at 11:30 pm our first night (jet lag, ya know).  when we checked in we were told many of the guests were \"transplants\" so we\\'d most likely have the pool and hot tub to ourselves.  which made me ask, why would people relocating to the area not want to use the pool?  doh!  she meant literally transplant patients at univ. hospital or the va.  i guess i went blond for the weekend...\\non the map, you\\'d think there would be major freeway noise as this hotel seriously couldn\\'t get any closer to the beltline.  we heard absolutely nothing.  either there\\'s good soundproofing or they shut the highway down at midnight.  also no noise from other rooms.\\ndecent standard buffet breakfast.  sunday paper had no funnies... did they take \\'em out or don\\'t they do that in wisconsin??\\ni would totally stay here again.',\n",

       " u\"i recently spoke with the manager regarding extended stays at this location and he provided a tour of the facilities and a couple rooms. i'm extremely impressed with the service and facilities and plan to go here for future visits while in the madison area.\",\n",
       " u'i\\'ve stayed here a couple times now.  if i reviewed my first stay if probably would have been 2 or 3 stars. lucky for them.  \\n\\nback to my most recent stay.  it was the best experience ever.  (second to the double tree in carmel, in.)  i walked in the lobby around 1pm and was greeted by bobbie.  he was handling the desk by himself and i explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \\n\\nmy husband was anxious to watch the bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen tv.  bobbie offered to check us in early and i asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  it appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\\n\\ni explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  the lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  after we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and that was the best they could do for us?  my husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  needless to say, he didn\\'t want me to request a \"closer\" room after that.  this is why i give them my request when i book the room.\\n\\nfortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. an extra bonus was that bobbie ask if i was priority club rewards member.  well i wasn\\'t, but i planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  thankfully, because bobbie asked me about it, i am now a priority club member! this is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how i can get extra points online.\\n\\ndid i say how great bobbie was?  well...he was everywhere!  he hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything i needed.  he also helped out with the breakfast buffet in the morning.  he literaly was everywhere!  it\\'s not like he was leaning on the counter when i saw him.  no, he was very proactive in genuinely making his guests feel comfortable.  he\\'s definitely a keeper.  \\n\\nwhenever i\\'m in the madison area, i will continue to book at this staybridge because of my experience and the excellent service that bobbie provided.',\n",
       " u'so i used the \"chat online with an agent\" option today.  you can find this link near the top, right side of the screen on the main overview page on thier website.  i\\'ve used this feature with other organizations in the past - so it wasn\\'t really new for me.  i chatted with vivian and she answered my quick question about dog fees in a timely manner.  that\\'s all i could ask for.  thanks vivian!  \\n\\nsince i wasn\\'t able to find \"dog fee\" information on the website, i offer the info here:\\n\\n\"pets allowed with nonrefundable fee of 75 usd per stay. no larger than 80 lbs. pet agreement must be signed at check in. call hotel for details. record of complete and up to date vaccinations required.\"\\n\\ni hope this helps all the dog lovers out there.  :)',\n",
       " u'i can\\'t say enough great things about this location in middleton.  earlier this year, i had a one-bedroom suite for almost three months.  a family member was in the hospital at uw-madison during this time and this hotel was more than accommodating for the specific needs in our situation.\\n\\ni\\'m not going to go into the specific details of the accommodations partly to protect individual privacy.  the other reason not to get so detailed is simply because i think the staff went so far out of their way that these \"favors\" may potentially be abused by other guests if they were aware of the extreme kindness.  \\n\\nas i mentioned, this hotel offered many special accommodations.  this allowed us to truly  feel like we had a \"home away from home\".  most of the staff knew me by name.  they were sensitive to the fact that i had a loved one who was in the hospital and critically ill. i wasn\\'t alone in this, though.  there were many other guests in a similar (if not same) situation as me.  this hotel could be a pilot for partnering up with hospitals in a win, win, win scenario that benefits the hotel, hospital, and the guest/patient.  in addition, i would not be surprised if they have special training for their staff in the area of customer service and handling special accommodations.  \\n\\nthe manager, brad, is visible and on-site on a regular basis.  he and his staff organize and manage a social for their guests three nights a week.  the social offers a free meal and drinks (including beer and wine) for a couple hours in the evening. and, as the name describes, it allows their guests an excellent opportunity to socialize.  \\n\\nthere are several hotel options recommended by uw and we tried three of them.  this one may be five miles away from the main uw hospital, but it is a straight shot along university avenue.  now that uw purchased the best western intowner, there is much more of a push with them recommending their newly owned property to uw patients.  the intowner is fine, but the best thing going for it is how close it is to the hospital. the staybridge-middleton, outshines them in so may ways - indoor pool, hot tub, laundry facility, garage, large suites, kitchenettes, socials, breakfast buffet,and most of all...the staff.\\n\\nunfortunately, i can not remember all the names of the staff that i would love to thank.  our housekeeper was perfect.  she cleaned only when we needed it and got to know our preferences.  for instance, she asked if we could use an extra box of kleenex because she remembered us requesting an extra box the week before.  she always did a great job cleaning and freshening up our room and never invaded our space. \\n\\ni noticed how well the staff work together as a team and support each other when the need arises.  it\\'s obvious that the staff members are cross-trained to manage various work areas and different shifts.  for instance, i first met bonnie on the shuttle.  she arrived at uw hospital to pick me up.  she even showed me a quicker route back to the hotel during rush hour.  during my stay, i also saw bonnie at the front desk, at the breakfast buffet, in the kitchen area, in the dining area, managing the socials, and even came to our suite to fix the television!  it turned out that the remote needed new batteries - which she was prepared for.\\n\\ni also feel like i got to know ana pretty well since she worked the breakfast buffet many mornings.  between her and bonnie, i just don\\'t know how they always seem to make everything run so smoothly.  \\n\\nthere is another lady with short blonde hair (sorry, i can\\'t seem to remember her name)  that always worked the socials.  she was so welcoming and learned what i like to eat and drink.  she even encouraged me to take food \"to-go\"  when i needed to rush back to the hospital.  it was like being with family.\\n\\njan, justin and bobby are always a pleasure at the front desk.  not only are they welcoming, but they go out their way to get answers to your questions and take care of any requests.  \\n\\nmy final comments are definitely not the least important.  during my stay, i noticed that there was a team of about three housekeeping staff members who appeared to have cognitive/mental disabilities.  i was so pleased to see this and know that this hotel and the manager recognize the need to utilize talents that are so often overlooked. there may have been moments of inconvenience for the guests or perhaps mistakes made by these staff members.  however, this is how they learn and become an integral part of society.  i commend brad cook for making diversity a priority.\\n\\nuntil my next stay...',\n",
       " u'location, location, location.  great place in downtown middleton.  close to all of the places you just need to visit, such as the mustard museum (yes, you need to go there), hubbard st. diner (try the pies or the carrot cake), and definitely go to the live band at the capital brewery a block away on friday night.  fantastic place to walk and just enjoy the ambiance of a great little town.  oh, and free breakfast, free food and drinks on tues-thurs, free morning newspapers and spacious suites are all wonderful.',\n",

       " u\"look, i love this place and i don't want you to join. it's the antithesis of the meat market known as princeton club. \\n\\nsadly, smoothie bar/cafe is gone. \\n\\nharbor is a really laid back health club that has everything that i need and more. the only downfalls are that it's super old and kind of put together like a corn maze.\\n\\n8 years and counting!\",\n",
       " u\"member here for 10 years total--  i love clean! i love being able to walk away from noisy kids and go into another pool since i am a swimmer i like choices. cool people -- members keep to themselves dont try to interfere with your workout with chit chat  i love this !! we are busy working out no talking needed ! great classes!  great equipment and you can use other clubs too with their membership win win \\nbut umm yeah don't join k? it is hard enough to find parking as it is !\\n\\ni went astray for a bit i will admit tried the princeton club to see what i was missing out on all the hoopla. what i found was old band aides that did not seem to move for days left around the pool and inches of standing water where you are supposed to wring out your suit nasty !!\\n\\ni found my way back and like the prodigal son who returns home after making mistakes i am back and i am happy!!\",\n",
       " u\"this is a well-run club that has seemingly unlimited choices for its members at a very reasonable price. the strength and cardio equipment is modern and always in working condition, and you rarely if ever have to wait for anything. the group fitness options are plentiful and the instructors are engaged and motivating. i don't partake, but there are a ton of yoga, pilates and barre offerings in the wellness center across the parking lot from the main facility. the pool areas are clean and well-maintained, and the water in the pools is kept at a comfortable temperature. i've worked out a harbor for a year now. the club has the appearance of a facility that has expanded multiple times as best it can given the architecture of the building and the space available. it's not easy to navigate as there are many separate rooms, but the staff is friendly and helpful and it's easy enough to figure things out once you get the hang of the layout. i wouldn't mind an update of the facility, but not at the expense of higher prices. it's clean and friendly and doesn't lack options and to me, that's most important.\",\n",

       " u\"somehow amid 18 credits both semesters of my senior year, i also managed to find time to do a whole lotta scrapbooking.  and this place pretty much carries everything and anything you need.  printed papers, solid papers, pens and markers and pencils, stickers, die-cuts, acid-free adhesives, scissors, punches, and a great selection of albums.  i think they have classes, too, but being the *expert* scrapbooker i am (brushes hair off shoulder), i never checked those out though i'm sure they're a lot of fun.  their workroom is well-stocked, and (*nerd alert!*) it is really fun & satisfying to lock yourself in a space like that with all the necessary tools and make an entire scrapbook in an evening or afternoon.\\n\\nmiddleton is really close to madison/the uw campus and convenient to get to.  the store is spacious and well laid-out; really, a photo-fanatic's dream!\",\n",
       " u'i have had too many negative experiences with the staff in this store.  today i tried going back after a year, and again the staff is so unhelpful, unknowledgeable and downright rude.  i called to talk with the manager, and her attitude is just as bad.  which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff.  there are plenty of other places to shop that actually appreciate and help customers.',\n",
       " u\"pricey, but plentiful. since all the local independent scrapbook stores in the madison area are now gone this is really the only option for good scrapbook supplies (apart from the small amounts at places like joann's or michaels) and they have most things you would need. \\n\\nrecently, i've been in a few times to use their workroom. it's free of charge sun - thu and you can have access to their tools and such. the chairs are very comfortable too. \\n\\nvery friendly staff, though they sometimes get a bit too chatty and aren't anywhere near the register when you need them. if i could improve archiver's, it would be to have a more attentive staff in regards to sales and more reasonable prices (for a large chain, they have prices on many things that are higher than small stores - bizarre).\",\n",
       " u\"never again will i shop this store!  i have been an extremely loyal customer for well over 5 years.  several weeks ago i made a very large purchase of many items in order to make a scrapbook for my daughter's bridal shower.  during the course of that shopping experience, an associate kindly offered to keep my selections at the checkout desk while i continued to shop; however, inadvertently another associate also added another customer's purchases to my pile as well, which i did not discover until a few days ago when i proceeded to put together the scrapbook.  when i attempted to return about $20 worth of merchandise that i had paid for but had not selected, i was told i was past their 30-day policy and i was simply out of luck. i later discovered, however, that i had returned these items without a receipt, i would have been given a store credit--which i had expressly requested but been denied because i was careful enough to save my receipt!  nope...no more of my business and i'm telling my story to every woman i know!\",\n",

       " u\"well, it's a michaels. nothing particularly special there. normally, i'd give most michaels stores 4stars, but this one tends to be a bit messy and has the wonkiest layout of any craft store. also, if you pop in and don't find what you're looking for, you have to loop through all the checkouts to exit (not just pass by one like at most similar stores). this makes me feel a bit uncomfortable if they happen to not have what i'm looking for or if i just stop in to price something, etc. \\n\\noverall, a decent place. greenway station on the whole is a bit of a weird shopping center, but i do love that a craft store is in the mix.\",\n",
       " u\"it's a strip mall near a bunch of hotels off the beltline.  they have a few cool stores like ann taylor loft, michaels, and a huge scrapbook store.  other than that, its nothing special and you're probably better off going to another mall in the area for a more extensive selection.\",\n",
       " u\"i differ on the previous review on greenway station. i wouldn't take the time to go to a traditional mall. first you have to park and then find the store you want to go to. this has wasted 45 minutes of my life. i guess if i had time to loiter and wander about i would share your view. malls are dieing across the country and life style centers are the future. in and out quickly.\",\n",
       " u\"i find the greenway station shopping center to be a nice retreat from the towne malls where i often feel claustrophobic breathing in recycled air, dodging oncoming traffic, and avoiding all the kiosk vendors...blech! conversely, greenway is never over-crowded, parking is easy to find, and during the spring/summer seasons you can get your daily dose of vitamin d while you shop.\\n\\nthe selection of shops is much smaller, yes, but the center also houses the higher-end, but still commercial, boutiques that you can't find elsewhere in madison (e.g. white house black market - one of my favorite boutique shops from back home). \\n\\nsolo shopping at greenway is definitely one of my favorite ways to spend a sunny sunday afternoon. :)\",\n",
       " u\"this mall was adjacent to the hotel where i was staying. it seemed to have some nice stores (loft), and the general mall stuff. i was excited that it had a world market (my favorite store of all time), and it was wednesday, double coffee points day! \\nhowever, nothing else stood out to me, and i wasn't impressed with the restaurant selection. in fact, that is a theme for madison in general. i had to drive a bit away to get something other than a sandwich for lunch.\",\n",
       " u\"i have mixed emotions.  i love coming here because it has locations of store that i can not find in other malls in the madison area.  however, the parking lot situation drives me crazy.  i am not sure what they were trying to do but it is annoying.  some days i find it impractical to walk the entire length of the area.  however, parking is just as frustrating.  between the winding roads and entrances of restaurants, i feel like it is only a matter of time before i accidentally hit a patron.  \\n\\nadmittedly, this is not just a problem for their venue.  so please take that with a grain of salt.  otherwise, i appreciate their wide range of stores from little box (like michael's) to the loft.  i also enjoy that the irish pub and cheeseburger in paradise are set a little ways away.  this allows them to be open air restaurants without dealing with the mall congestion.\",\n",
       " u\"greenway station is a total joke.  it seems like the management can't keep businesses to stay more than six months.  they don't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop.  there really is no big draw.  the resturants are worthless.  no men's stores what so ever.  on top of all this the location is horrible.  make this a dead mall and it will be more exciting.\",\n",
       " u'the whole chain of barriques around the madison area are wonderful.  this one boasts a fireplace that my friend and i spent hours in front of trying to stay warm last weekend.  the staff was friendly and the atmosphere is cozy.  the extensive wine and liquor collection made me almost salivate. 5 stars.',\n",
       " u'i agree with kelly. the staff is really knowledgeable about their wines and i love the variety. the atmosphere is excellent. depending on when you go, you can get good baristas or not-so-good baristas. but when you get a good one, the whole place is absolutely fabulous.',\n",
       " u'i love almost everything about the middleton location. big tables to study at or meet friends, great selection of wine and beer, free internet access and busy enough to not feel strange but slow enough that you can almost always get a seat. also their wine tasting is a lot of fun and interesting when i want to play adult for a night. the only downfall is that the service can tend to be somewhat indifferent to you standing behind the counter. overall a great place.',\n",
       " u\"barrique's in general is great - they know their wine, and they serve milwaukee's own alterra coffees and baked goods.i've been to two of their other madison locations and enjoy the laid-back atmosphere and comfortable seating areas. \\n\\nhowever, this morning on my way out of middleton, the staff at the middleton coffee trader location was dismal. at 7:30 a.m., the assumption in a coffee shop three blocks from a major freeway entrance should probably be that people are on their way to work, or just generally not interested in a leisurely 15-minute wait for a latte!\\n\\nwhen i entered the store there was one person already waiting for an espresso drink, one person ahead of me and no one behind me. after one of the three employees rung me up, i waited several minutes as the barista very leisurely made the person in front of me's cappucino. she was literally pulling an espresso, standing for a few seconds talking to the other girl, then steaming the milk, then standing, and so on.\\n\\nafter she finally finished the other guy's drink, she wiped her area down and took her sweet time to start my drink. it was very obvious i was there waiting, and very obvious that she was just wasting time. meanwhile, her and one of the other employees started to argue with one another, all the while she does nothing. finally, i tried to make eye contact with one of them, because i really was in a hurry to get back to milwaukee. finally, she made my drink, slooooooowly. \\n\\nas an aside, i'm not that uptight or fast-paced of a person, but customer service with no customer focus really gets on my nerves, and there is simply no excuse for ignoring a customer in a coffee shop at 7:30 in the morning. the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.\",\n",
       " u\"although this might not be my favorite barriques location, it is closest to me. still has the great alterra coffee, but i'm just not sure about the atmosphere. not that there's anything horrible to report, but it's just not the most relaxing location. easy to get in and out of, which is a plus.\",\n",
       " u\"i'm going to say that i like it better here than the downtown madison location for a very simple reason: seating. it's also a great option to have when stuck out in middleton for the holidays. this place helps that little middleton stay classy and it helps me stay sane when i make my annual return to the west side.\\n\\notherwise, i'm staying in madison for my coffees.\",\n",
       " u'i love the concept of a coffee shop/wine & beer store in one. the tea selection was nice & the atmosphere quaint. the lattes were better than starbucks (but really- is that saying much?)',\n",
       " u\"coffee is fine, although i agree with laura f. below. service has always been very slow, despite 3 baristas working at the counter. i'd recommend not stopping here on your way to work, but its an ok place to pick up a latte on the weekend or get a bottle of wine.\",\n",
       " u\"i was intrigued when i heard that there was a place that combined a liquor store with a coffee shop. i don't know that the 2 necessarily compliment each other... in fact, the counters for both have their backs to each other.\\n\\nin any event, they have a good selection that is fun to browse through, and they make a decent cup of coffee.\",\n",
       " u'they should call it s&m wine & spirits. the worst of the barriques around.... the attitude from the girls working there! they do everything they can to make you feel you are beneath them. i work in middleton and was stopping daily until i could not put up with the attitude any more. the final draw was when i stood there at the counter for 20min with other customer behind me waiting while i got to listen to. \"you know\" \"oh my god\" \"she didn\\'t\". \"really, really\" \"oh my god\" \"he hooked up with who\". the girl working the cash register would look over at me and the others waiting and roll here eyes as she kept on talking with the barista.... when she did take my order she got it wrong. this is basically what i got for service for weeks, so i don\\'t chalk this up to a single rotten apple.',\n",
       " u'i have yet to walk away from this barriques location not disappointed. horrible, horrible, horrible service. slow, unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes! i have the unfortunate fate of working in the same business district as this location, and it is the only coffee shop within a reasonable distance. i now drive 10 minutes out of my way to work to get coffee and breakfast because i refuse to give those people any of my money. please stay away from this location - this warning comes from a girl who has never written a bad review of any place! boo barriques! :(',\n",
       " u\"this review is for one thing only: iced coffee.\\n\\ni travel a lot for work and try to seek out a local coffee shop to get my iced coffee fix. normally, i'm disappointed...not so with barriques.  the iced coffee (listed as cold brewed for 12 hours) is delicious.  dark and strong just as i prefer.\",\n",
       " u'great place to chill...  always quiet and can get lots of work done...',\n",
       " u'pretty stoked that although salads are pre-made these guys dug out ingredients and made me one from scratch sans dairy. mucho appreciated!',\n",
       " u\"it doesn't match the layout of the other barriques and the seating area is a little cramped and sparse.  still serves the great coffee that i have come to know and love but unlike their other cafe's, the staff is a little surly and indifferent at times.\",\n",
       " u\"tips for meeting at barriques on university ave/ cayuga court:\\na. make sure your friend is meeting you at this one and not the barriques on old sauk.\\nb. parking can be tricky, but they have spots in the front, back and on the street.\\nc. grab a spot near the fireplace in the winter.  can be a bit breezy in there.\\nd. perhaps get a fortified coffee drink, (as in with some special ingrediants) daddy grasshopper, irish coffee, etc... they make them up right.\\ne. if you have to pass d. there are still plenty of good options for coffee & tea drinkers.\\nf. not as many food options at this location but they do have cookies, scones, bagels, etc..\\ng. plan on getting some good people watching in.  turns from business crowd, to mama yoga crowd, back to business to the student crowd during the day.  take your pick.\\nh. hard not to pick up a bottle of booze to take home with you.  lots of good local options or plenty others.\\ni. and if you checked in with yelp, you'd notice it's 20 % off whole bean coffee. yes\\nrepeat!\\nrepeat!\\nrepeat!\",\n",
       " u'nice overall atmosphere, the fireplace and comfy chairs are very inviting. coffee is always good and the cowboy cookie is a round slice of ambrosia.  huge wine selection and wine accessories are also a draw.',\n",
       " u'any place that serves both caffeine and alcohol, then gives you access to reliable wifi and leaves you alone for five hours is good in my book.',\n",
       " u\"the china wok buffet is the best chinese buffet i've ever been too! i only give it a 4 instead of a 5 because if i find something better(very unlikely) i won't be able to rate it as such. this buffet has everything you could want from chinese food. it has a delicious array of chicken's, pork, and seafood. my personal fav's are the tso's, peppered chicken, crab cheese bake, deep fried shrimp, and the baked salmon. their crab rangoon, egg rolls, and soup are fair. finally their desert. unlike most chinese buffets i've been to this one buckets of ice cream. you serve yourself but you get a decent assortment of mint chocolate chip, strawberry, butter pecan, and birthday cake. if your ever in the mood to over indulge on food at a really good price. i definitely recommend going here.\",\n",
       " u\"i typically hate and do not recommend chinese buffets, but this is totally the exception. i have been going to this buffet for a few years now, and it is great every time.  they don't overstock the buffet, so they keep the items fresh all the time.  from the soups, to apps to the main dishes, is very good food.  remember, its chinese, so stay away from the sushi, its not up to par with the rest of the buffet.  finally, there is ice cream kind of hidden in the back.   put a scoop or two on top of a hot doughunt or two and you will finish in heaven.\",\n",
       " u'i went to this place at 7pm. and most of the food was cold or warm some hot fresh food. that was good but not for 10.75.  the only thing was great was the ice cram.',\n",
       " u\"went there on saturday night to get some food to go. on of the worst chinese buffets i've seen. half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. very little selection. the worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, wtf is that!!! so we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. bottom line: eat somewhere else.\",\n",
       " u\"not good, not bad, this place is a fine choice if you're looking for totally mediocre but plentiful food. that being said, i would not recommend the place to friends.\",\n",
       " u\"this place is great for what it is.  i've never been disappointed - even after the lunch rush is over the food is kept fresh and rotated.  i can't speak for dinner, but lunch is as good as chinese buffets get in the madison/middleton locale.  jade garden is good if they are busy, but they let the food go to pot when they slow down a little.\",\n",
       " u'i live close by and stop in periodically and have not had any issues with food or service.  i have left full and happy every time.  \\n\\nhot food...all the sushi you can eat!\\n\\nkeep up the good work!',\n",
       " u\"this place is average. lots of food. speedy staff. it's a casual buffet. great for business lunch\",\n",
       " u'some of the food on the buffet is quite good. the szechwan pork and barbecue pork stand out in my recollection. the fried rice is memorable for its blandness and frozen peas and carrots. cabbage was apparently the only ingredient that they could find to stuff their egg rolls with.\\n\\nthis gets lows ratings for staff and service. we were barely acknowledged upon entrance and completely ignored when attempting to pay. one drink refill arrived at all, and even then it was about 7 minutes later than desired. the manager chatted quite loudly on his phone while we and several others tried to settle our bills. he grunted in lieu of speaking and made his best effort to lob the receipts over the counter to avoid ever being within 6 inches of his customers.',\n",
       " u'not sure why i keep deciding to come back here. rice is rock hard and has no flavor, along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays. $10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? no thanks.',\n",
       " u\"a completely unexpected find. while on a trip to madison we wandered into this cafe after checking out the local grocery across the street (it's an odd obsession of ours to check out grocery stores when in a new town). when you're starving and pop into the first place you see, you hope for a sandwich with no mold on the bread and a halfway clean glass for your soda. this was light years beyond that.\\n\\ni had the special salad of the day. it was delicious, a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery, and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese i've had in a very long time. my lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious. \\n\\ndecor was a tad dark, and since we were there for a late lunch we were the only ones not sitting alone playing with laptops. however, the tchotkes and lending library helped create a friendly neighborhood hangout feel.\",\n",
       " u\"if you need a tasty breakfast for cheap, saunter in here(well, the sauntering might cause some dirty looks--it's pretty low key). \\n\\nthis place has tasty treats behind the glass case, and a variety of breakfast dishes on their menu. i love the vast bread choices, and the fact that they serve alterra coffee(our fave). \\n\\na bit of interesting art to view, and a nice sunny place to sit outside, if you choose. \\n\\nyay for sundays.\",\n",
       " u\"i had stopped in to the prairie cafe & bakery several times since it opened to buy scones for the office, and i hadn't really given it much thought beyond this purpose.  i really liked the scones, but i didn't like the fact that they didn't open until 7 which usually made me a bit late.  i didn't even consider that they might have more than bakery goods, and every time i had stopped the place seemed empty.  this was of course due to the fact that it was 7:01 am and i was the first person through the door.  so this weekend, based on chris & kelly's recommendations, i stopped in for a nice leisurely breakfast before heading into the office.  i found out that all this time i was seriously overlooking a great place right in my neighborhood.\\n\\ni was a bit taken aback by the number of people inside.  the place was pleasantly crowded, with the warm buzz of morning conversations and a relaxed atmosphere.  i walked up and ordered the breakfast special - i was used to just picking out scones so it took me a minute to get my bearings and find the menu board.  the price was ok, not under $6 but not more than i would have expected anywhere else.  i was given a number and found a nice table along the bookshelves.  i'd never really taken the time to look around the place before, and i was really impressed by the decor.  i got a cup of coffee from the self-service area, which is a great idea - i love diners where your cup is constantly refilled but i tend to keep drinking so long as there's coffee in the cup, leading to the over-caffienated jitters.  the coffee was excellent, truly delicious and fair trade to boot.  i savored it while i read a magazine and waited on my breakfast.\\n\\nafter a bit of a wait the breakfast special came out.  the wait wasn't especially long considering the amount of people there, but i was into my second cup of coffee by the time my food came.  it was served on a fairly large plate, so my first impression was that there was not much to it, but this was a mistake.  the special, which was basically a denver scrambler, was completely satisfying, filling but not heavy.  the wheat toast was much better than the average bread you get with breakfast, quite possibly highlight of the food.  i was pleasantly surprised by the whole breakfast experience here.  i wasn't planning on finding such a great place for breakfast in the prairie cafe.  maybe one of these days i'll get a chance to try lunch here too.\",\n",
       " u'i have visited prairie cafe several times and love it. the breakfast/lunch menu is varies from great egg dishes to tasty sandwiches and salads. vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike will find somthing satisfying. good selection of in-house, serve-yourself coffee. i tried the \"health shake,\" --sort of a cross between a shake and a smoothie. very tasty and a perfect breakfast. very comfortable atmosphere with free wireless. seems to attract a \"usual\" crowd. overall a very positive experience.',\n",
       " u\"i've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed with prairie. the food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable. the cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. all are served with a choice of side; i favor the black bean and corn salad. breakfast is no exception to prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling. and it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks. prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be.\",\n",
       " u\"i've only been here two or three times and i agree that this little cafe is a well kept secret. the food is good and healthy, the fireplace cozy, and the original art on the walls is a nice touch. great place to meet a friend for lunch. haven't tried breakfast or bakery but the chai latte was warm and tasty. they also have some vegetarian choices. about a year ago we went and the lobster bisque was really salty, but i wouldn't hesitate to order soup from them again. i picked up the fabulous arts commission calendar there last year and this year. just found out they have free wi-fi. check their hours before you go and bring cash or check, no cc.\",\n",
       " u\"i desperately needed some lunch and came on this gem. i had the almond chicken salad sandwich on a fresh 7-grain bagette with corn & bean salad. the sandwich was amazing. i didn't really care for the salad, but that didn't taint my experience.\",\n",
       " u\"delicious food.  good prices.  they serve alterra coffee - awesome!  my only complaint is that they don't accept credit cards.\",\n",
       " u'a solid little place for breakfast and lunch - my experiences have been good, but not \"outstanding\" - it\\'s pretty difficult to have a bad breakfast (although perkins seems to have mastered the art of the worst breakfast), so i\\'m going with 3-stars: a-ok.\\n\\nthe place gets a little busy on weekends; i\\'ve been there both during the week and on weekends.  it\\'s largely a \"self-service\" type place, which is fine by me.  you place your order at the main counter, get your own coffee and condiments, find a table and wait for the food to arrive.  when you\\'re done eating, you clear your own table, take the dishes to the \"dish basket\" and head on your merry way.\\n\\nthe pancakes aren\\'t anything spectacular - just your regular \"mix made\" pancakes.  they\\'re cooked well, with nice color, and are \"plate size\" so one or two should be plenty for most folks.  they\\'re not obscenely thick; in fact, they\\'re a bit on the thin side, come to think of it.\\n\\nbreakfast sandwich is decent - an egg, your choice of meat, some cheese, and served on a muffin.\\n\\ni\\'ve also had the wright breakfast and today, i had the special, which was two eggs, scrambled with tomatoes, peppers, onion, ham, cheese and a choice of toast.  again - it was good, but not \"out of this world great.\"\\n\\nthey\\'re currently serving alterra-brand coffee; another review references ancora, but it looks like they\\'ve switched to alterra.  it\\'s good coffee, nonetheless.\\n\\nstaff keeps largely to themselves, which is nice - no one bothers you throughout the meal.  they don\\'t take credit/debit cards - it\\'s cash or check only.  there\\'s a fair amount of seating indoors and a few metal tables and chairs outside for when the weather is nice.  there tends to be a lot of families that meet here on the weekends, so if kids aren\\'t your thing, steer clear on saturday and sunday.  i had the joy of listening to two screaming kids during my entire meal this morning - the parents were oblivious... \\n\\nmy biggest gripe?  price.  my breakfast this morning (\"special\" plus two pancakes plus coffee) cost $14.10.  that\\'s a little steep for standard breakfast fare...\\n\\nbreakfast is served all-day long on saturday and sunday; during the week it\\'s served until 11am, at which point it\\'s lunch only until closing time (around 3pm, i believe).',\n",
       " u'i happened upon this charming restaurant and loved the simple and warm feel of the place. i had visions of an egg breakfast but it was too late in the day, so the wait person suggested the quiche which did not disappoint.  i was on the road so stopping at the prairie cafe was just the right thing to do.',\n",

       " u\"marvelous little breakfast spot. my husband and i spent the weekend in middleton and came here twice because it was so good! \\n\\nreally enjoyed the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out to the table. the fair-trade coffee was outstanding, as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. i was particularly blown away by the chocolate croissant, which i couldn't imagine could trump my favorite at bennison's in evanston il but it was deliciously buttery, flakey and had the best chocolate filling i've ever had in pain chocolat! my husband swore that his mocha was the best he's had in his life. kind of makes us want to move out here!\",\n",
       " u\"just got back from having breakfast with the girls! it rocked! excellent breakfast! two of us had the scramble special & one had a scone - to die for! great atmosphere! easy place to meet family & friends and/or work! i'll be going back very soon! :)\",\n",
       " u'i used to love this place - i came here once every week or two for breakfast and to sit and write for an hour or two (i\\'m a grad student working on my thesis). the food is expensive (~$12 for two eggs, toast, bacon, coffee) and the coffee isn\\'t great, but the atmosphere is nice and i didn\\'t come all that often so it seemed like sort of a luxury. the staff also isn\\'t particularly outgoing, though not downright rude... until today. \\n\\ntoday is sunday, and i arrived around 8am. i usually try to get there kind of early and leave before it gets busy so i\\'m not taking up a table. i bought a big breakfast (as described above) and sat down to work. just over an hour later, i was approached by a middle-aged man whom i assume is the owner or manager but whom i\\'ve never seen before. he asked if i was aware of their \"new policy\" about wi-fi on sunday mornings, and how they don\\'t want people just hanging out using the internet when it gets crowded. (no sugar coating, that\\'s almost verbatim what he said.) for the record, i wasn\\'t actually using their wi-fi, i was writing. whatever. his point was obvious. i stared at him for a few seconds because i couldn\\'t believe that a proprietor was actually asking me, a paying customer, to leave when i had been there only an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate. he suggested it was fine for now but that when it started to get crowded i should get out. i said that if that\\'s how they felt i would leave now, and he responded, \"that\\'s exactly how we feel.\" i was shocked, and still am. i have never, never been treated so disrespectfully in a place of business. and i\\'m a regular, paying customer!! i always leave a tip! i still can\\'t believe i was treated this way.\\n\\ni will no longer recommend this place, now that they\\'ve shown their true colors. if the food was exceptional i might try to swallow my pride, but it\\'s really nothing special. there are several other breakfast/coffee shops in the area (including a starbucks across the road) and i will be patronizing them instead from now on.',\n",

       " u'time has not been kind to this cold stone creamery location.  for a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  the buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  i stopped by this weekend while shopping at greenway station and found the store devoid of patrons.  i know it\\'s been a long, cold winter, but we wisconsinites love our ice cream and babcock hall was standing room only when i visited later that same day.\\n\\nso why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew cold stone?\\n* texture - i really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that\\'s not what you get at cold stone.  the texture is far too gooey for my liking.  it\\'s not terrible, but i much prefer the denser texture of the product at babcock dairy or the chocolate shoppe any day of the week and twice on sunday.  the other textural problem is that cold stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \\n \\n* flavor - the ice cream here is too sweet.  at cold stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  again, it\\'s not terrible, but it\\'s just not my cup of tea.\\n\\n* serving size - the theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  while i am not a huge fan of froyo, at least i can control my serving size when i visit the near-by menchies or orange leaf.  in addition, while i\\'m on the topic of serving sizes, can i just add that i detest the cutesy \"like it\", \"love it\" and \"gotta have it\" serving size names.\\n\\n* service - when the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  i admit it was hokey, but i kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  but now, a trip to cold stone is more like visiting a gulag.  leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \"ice cream, baby\" sung to the tune of ice, ice baby.  my other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  it\\'s really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\\n\\n* pro tip: if you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (i learned that the hard way.)',\n",
       " u'i don\\'t recommend going there.  my wife and i decided to go there for some dessert after a very nice dinner.  i wanted an \"apple pie a la cold stone\".  i have had this before and it is normally very good.  i was told that they had been out of the pie filling for a while.  yet this is one of their \"signature creations\".  i would expect that if this is something that they always have that they would have on their menu, they would have the ingredients for it.  then, my wife ordered their seasonal \"funnel cake sundae.  my wife ended up waiting 15 minutes for this.  jacob and chad told us that they had to reheat the funnel cake for the sundae twice.  this made is rock hard and she had to throw most of the funnel cake away because she could not eat it.  as we were waiting, i noticed how dirty the entire interior was.  it looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months.  tables and floors were dirty and sticky-gross.  i did not check the bathrooms, too scared to try.  on top of all this, the price for their \"creations\" is way too high!!!  i am tempted to call the health department for an inspection.  don\"t go there!!!  it is a waste of time and money.',\n",

       " u\"at its best the bristled boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  at its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  i've seen both over the last five years.  when i first visited the boar it was a dive.  my college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  the barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  there is a certain charm to dive bars and i'm sure for some the old boar had it, but not for me.  \\n\\nfortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time i moved out to middleton.  in place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  the ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  there is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  the jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  the regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the boar these days.  some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  i can't say that i've tried much of the food.  i know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  the emil's pizzas are good as always.  all in all the new boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\\n\\nthere are still a few things that keep the boar from being my favorite in middleton, namely the tap selection.  i am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is spotted cow i call foul.  i can't think of another middleton bar that doesn't have at least one capital tap, or at least esser's best.  what really seals it for me is sometimes the spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  another complaint that i frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  it is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.\",\n",
       " u'i just went there for drinks with friends this past week (either weds or thurs, i can\\'t remember which right now).  they had an excellent drink special--$2.50 absolut mixers.  woohoo!  \\n\\nit\\'s an odd place.  it\\'s got an \"up north lodge\"-kind of vibe in one part of the bar; wood paneling  complete with a boar\\'s head with glowing red eyes.  the other part, i *believe* had a different theme without wood paneling and a linoleum floor with a pool table.  there was a volleyball court outside.  the crowd was a strange mix of middle aged drunks and skanky-dressed younger girls.  \\n\\noverall, i have nothing against the bar, and would go back if i was at my friend\\'s house again.',\n",
       " u\"the bristled boar!! just the name in itself is a sign of class.  with its barn like exterior, and its huge boar's head are signs of a true townie bar the town of middleton can be proud of.  \\n\\nas you walk in, the open area for the pool, foosball, and darts is a nice area separated from the bar allowing proper game play and competition. also the boar's juke has a very nice display of music including some of my personal fav's shinedown, system of a down, and hinder. the bar also has an interesting array of  patron's for the true elderly drunks that have been attending this place from their mid 30's to those of the younger ages just looking to throw a few to many back. it allows for many interesting interactions making an evening here very fun!!\\n \\nagreed with other reviews the beer selection is limited but they do have a descent array of hard liquors especially my personal favorite whiskey!! the prices from my one time stop seemed reasonable and the drinks actually had some liquor in them instead of just soda or water.\\n \\ni have yet to try any food or enjoy their volleyball courts but would recommend that anyone interested in a townie atmosphere with the possibility of some excitement to give the place a try. i know i look forward to taking some of my friends to this place to get their opinions of what i like to call middleton's best townie bar!!!\",\n",
       " u'not gonna lie....its a dive. but its the lesser of the evils of the surrounding bars(club tavern and branch st. retreat are much worse). the bar is usually not packed they have a decent selection of tap beers and almost always have decent drink specials. i was there a few weeks ago and the special was jameson mixers for $3.50 on a friday...not bad.\\n\\noverall if your in the area its worth stopping at but nothing spectacular.',\n",

       " u\"i've been really happy with all pets.  they have nice, convenient hours and the staff has always been great.  being open until 6 p.m. on weekdays is really helpful; the extra hour makes a big difference.  my two cats regularly see  dr. haroldson and both have seen dr. erickson for injuries/infections. \\n\\ni've had no trouble making appointments for regular check ups and vaccinations.  when either cat has had unexpected problems (eye infection, infected cut, etc.) they've been able to get me in within a day, although i was not picky about what vet i saw.  both drs. haroldson and erickson have patiently and carefully talked me through what i needed to do for home-care and answered all of my questions.  i've never felt rushed or talked down to.\",\n",

       " u\"love all pets!  \\n\\nwe drive all the way from mcfarland to middleton to go here because the staff, from the front desk to all the doctors, truly care about the animals.  i've seen vet techs carrying sick animals around in slings to give them extra attention and care.  i've had them stay open waiting for me to arrive, they work you in for appointments as necessary.  \\n\\nseriously can't say enough great things about this clinic.\",\n",

       " u\"the hody is a pretty solid local bar in middleton that often has great live music and decent drink specials.  thursday nights feature westside andy & mel ford, and that is always a good time.  there are decent taps, though last time i was there i believe they had removed esser's best which was my go-to every time there.  most of the specials tend toward the $1 shot variety, but i especially like that capital pints are $2 on wednesdays and you can get pitchers of spotted on fridays for a crazy $5.  i also learned that your second drink before noon on sundays is free, and domestic taps are 50 cents.  more on that later.  the bartenders are for the most part good, but if you're there on the wrong day they seem to forget about you in favor of talking with the regulars.\\n\\nthe food is pretty standard: not too fancy but good.  sometimes the food doesn't come as advertised in the menu.  once i ordered a reuben that strangely was lacking swiss cheese, though i didn't notice until halfway through as it was still a tasty sandwich.  i like the bison burger here, but the last time i ordered this it came sans tomatoes, likely due to the salmonella issue at the time.  also that day my sister found the hody chicken's buffalo sauce to be beyond her tolerance for spiciness.  my sister's boyfriend was suitably impressed with the hody burger, but he thought that they had left of the special hody sauce.  it might have just been a bad day, because most of the other times i've been here there were no problems.  i do believe that the overall quality depends on the day you stop in.  some of the bartenders kind of throw things together, while others take their time and do a decent job.  i haven't been there regularly enough to establish a schedule, so it's been hit or miss for me lately.  i've also tried a few of the appetizers and the onion straws and quesidilla wrappers are very good every time i've had them.  \\n\\nthe main drawback with the hody is the regular crowd.  on thursdays when westside andy & mel ford are playing the crowd is great - a variety of people, young and old, some dancing to the music, some sitting at the bar or nearby tables.  other nights the crowd can get a bit too townie for my liking.  it can be uncomfortable, especially when half the bar turns to look at you when you walk in.  sundays can be the worst.  i think that some of those people nearly live there.  the place is pretty open and there is a lot of space, but it still can get quite smoky.  there is a few outdoor tables along elmwood, and these are perfect for a weekend afternoon.  i would probably return to the hody more if it weren't for the small inconsistencies in the food and the slight hostile feeling that i sometimes pick up from the regulars, but overall the hody is a reliably good time.\",\n",

       " u\"one of my favorite dining experiences in the madison area. the underground atmosphere at louisianne's is quaint yet not unsophisticated; we went on the eve of a snowstorm, so the pianist didn't make it in to play--though i'm sure he would have made a nice dinnertime addition.\\n\\nservice was friendly and efficient. our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent--akin to bruschetta, but minus the tomatoes and plus pine nuts and a decadent lemon-y parmesan topping. for an entree, i ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes, and wasn't disappointed... though i will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side. i didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation of blackened fire-breathing between bites.\\n\\ni was also pleased with the wine selection. and really, how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert? thanks, louisianne's, for a warm, inviting dinner--and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors!\",\n",
       " u'tops: ambiance, particularly on a cold winter night.  wine list - well balanced and fairly priced.  sitting at the bar listening to music - you could do it all night. \\n\\nfood: good, but can be a bit over-rich at times and it is not cheap. desserts are uber. \\n\\nservice: for me, it has always been good.',\n",
       " u'not knock your socks off but good. atmosphere in the downstairs dining room is nice quiet. a good place to go with friends and have a conversation.  i had the escargot which was good -- could have had a little more garlic. red beans & rice was especially good. salad was average. for out of towners staying at the \"big box\" motels at the edge of town this place is way better than the chain restaurants around the motels and well worth the short walk into town (maybe not in winter).',\n",
       " u\"i was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food. what i got was a plate full of super-salty rice and beans. i couldn't finish it and left hungry. i'm hoping it was just a mistake. i'll give it another try one of these days.\",\n",
       " u\"i decided, after much positive feedback from clients of mine(and a peek at my fellow yelpers reviews), to surprise my bf with dinner at louisianne's for our third anniversary tonight. from the moment we walked in, i was really charmed. it has this cavernous feel(in a good, cozy romantic way--not a dank, moldy creepy way) with nice lighting and just all around nice ambiance. \\n\\nour waitress was good, if a bit overzealous...and i loved the fact that she automatically brought me a small carafe of iced tea when she brought my filled glass. nice. i'm a heavy(tea) drinker, so this was great! i enjoyed my shrimp and corn chowder, but i would have liked to have seen a bit more shrimp(but when is too much shrimp ever possible). i also had roasted shrimp for my entree, which were delicious! nice spicy flavor, with a ton of rosemary. i wasn't too impressed with the side of spinach and tomatoes, however. the cabernet reduction that they came doused in was a bit too rich. i wish it had been more of a glaze than a heavy sauce. no matter, i was too full to eat much of it anyhow. my boyfriend seemed surprised and delighted by the coffee roasted chicken with the orange-ricotta sauce( the bite i had was quite tasty). \\n\\nalso, i love the fact that they have live jazz on the piano tues-sat nights starting at 6pm(although tonight he started more like 6:30). it was really nice. we said that we would definitely go another night for drinks and appetizers(which looked tempting) in the bar/lounge area with friends.\",\n",
       " u\"louisianne's has seared it's place inside of my restaurant experience. the food is so good, that every time my girlfriend and i consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not going to louisianne's.\\n\\nthe place is dungeon-esque, but not in a bad way. it's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the new orleans mood.\\n\\nthe food is incredible. every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good the meals are, and how much of it you get. the appetizers were delicious (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing each time, with an intense flavor.\\n\\ntheir specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. we've had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not only did we get one delicious meal, but enough to have an amazing lunch the next day.\\n\\nthe only con i can give louisianne's is that they give you so much good food that you can never get to the desserts. this restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and i benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly consider the consequences of not going to louisianne's.\",\n",
       " u\"my boyfriend and i went here on a whim one night.  i was totally underwhelmed.\\n\\nfirst of all, the service was reeeeeally slow.  from the appetizer on down, everything took forever to arrive.\\n\\nthe lemon parmesan artichoke hearts were delicious!  the flavors were all perfect.  that was my favorite part of the meal.  my salad was good.  my boyfriend didn't like his soup, so we traded.  the soup was just okay.\\n\\ni ordered the maple cured duck, and i was surprised at how fatty and tough my duck was.  i really had a hard time eating it because the texture in my mouth made me kind of gag.  the veggies it came with were good, and the flavor of the duck was good.  i'm not normally one to order duck, and i really wished i didn't (i was torn about the coffee chicken.  i normally get chicken, but it seemed like an odd combo of flavors). my boyfriend got the seafood au gratin which was much better.\\n\\nthe best part was that i was so full on bread by the time my entree arrived that i didn't feel like so much of an ass asking for most of my meal to be put in a doggie bag.  i'd be willing to give this place another chance though.\",\n",
       " u\"met some friends here for drinks at the bar, which is shockingly small and not suited for groups larger than 4. the house wines are excellent. i got the lemon artichoke hearts - which were awful, and overpriced. the bread crumbs were drenched in butter and had a greasy feel to them, and the lemon was overpowering. the piano player didn't know any of the songs my friends or i requested - and we weren't making ridiculous requests - what piano player doesn't know irving berlin? \\n\\nit's a great place to sit and talk and drink wine, after you've eaten somewhere else.\",\n",
       " u\"i saw lousianne's on the news one night.  so i took my boyfriend there for our date night.  \\n\\nwe were extremely underdressed for the occasion.  a co-worker had told me it was a little fancier than casual but we went totally casual anyway.  good news is, it had dim lightening.  we had a drink at the bar and were quickly seated.  i'm a vegetarian, so i tried a pasta dish while my boyfriend had steak.  we had the goat cheese appetizer, it was better than i expected.  it had a sauce to it that had a really unique taste to it.  the entrees were good, i wouldn't say the pasta was worth the price and i wish i would have tried the vegetarian jambalaya.  we topped off the meal with the white chocolate mousse  for dessert.  it was the best part of the whole meal, knocked my socks off.\\n\\ni would recommend this place, especially to meat eaters.  \\nthe service was great, our waitress was timely.  she checked in often and never hurried us to finish and leave.\",\n",
       " u\"all our friends had raved about the food & ambiance, so my wife & i finally decided to try louisianne's.  the decor is indeed cozy- like a nicely made-up cellar.  there was plenty of room at the bar so we sat there before our reservation time arrived.  only two beers on tap, but both good local brews from capital. \\neventually sat at our table & perused the menu.  found many appetizers that sounded really good (including one of the specials that night) so we decided on sharing 2 apps and one entree... seemed like a good way to try a few items without getting too much food.\\napp #1 (the special): gnocchi in a savory cream sauce with crawfish was very tasty.  seemed a bit light in the gnocchi (i think there were 5 or 6) but made up for it in sauce.  two thumbs way up.\\napp #2: mussels in cream sauce... i had asked about the size of the mussels ahead of time and was told they were medium to large.  they were in fact medium to small, which was a bit of a bummer because we probably would have gone with a different app had we known.  but the flavors were good & we enjoyed sopping up the sauce with the bread.  and the bread they serve is quite good.  two thumbs up.\\nentree: crawfish etouffe... i was excited to try this as i hadn't had etouffe in years.  it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  if you went to a friend's house for dinner and they served this you'd be psyched, but at an upscale cajun restaurant for $20 you may be left underwhelmed.  two thumbs halfway up.  the salad that came with was fresh mesclun greens, with a bleu cheese dressing that was chunky but bland.\\nmidway thru our meal the jazz combo started up and sounded really good- definitely added to the atmosphere.  for dessert we shared a slice of key lime pie... nice-tasting but no great shakes.  it seemed to be thickened with gelatin and i suppose i prefer mine to be creamier, plus it was lacking in zing, but only mildly.  again, if your friend served it you'd rightfully congratulate them but for $6.50 it should be really good.\\nour server was very nice & professional.  absolutely no complaints there.\\nthe nicest surprise came with the bill- only $70... and that included 5 drinks.\\nwe have concluded that the next time we go we'll sit in the bar area and have drinks & apps.\",\n",
       " u'crazy good food, excellent wine list, text book waitstaff. best atmosphere for date night!  not good for kids. make a reservation!!',\n",
       " u'i don\\'t care about \"ambiance\" or \"decor\" anymore.  i hit 40 and it doesn\\'t matter to me anymore.\\n\\ni am more concerned about food.\\n\\nthis food is awesome.\\n\\ngo, it is incredible.',\n",
       " u\"good food, i would call it new orleans inspired rather then real creole cooking. that said i have never had bad service or bad food here. it is really nice setting for a date or dinner out. not too spicy to scare the native wisconsin's, including my wife.\",\n",
       " u\"the raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing had actual raspberries in it. ok. just had to get that off my chest. the dressing surprised me and i'll go back for more than just that. \\n\\nwe arrived on a saturday night without a reservation.  i believe we took one of the last tables available until 9 or so. i would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available. there are a few high top tables that are seated in an area with live music.  the place is small and intimate. it's the perfect place for a first date. \\n\\nwe started with the lemon parmesan artichoke hearts which were nothing like i expected but were rich and flavorful. we weren't terribly hungry so i ordered and appetizer for my entr\\xe9e and my boyfriend ordered the special. i tried the crawfish cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. it was tasty and would make the perfect appetizer for a table of four but i wouldn't recommended as a main entr\\xe9e.\\n\\nthe special was the highlight of the meal. i couldn't repeat it if my life depended on it, but i heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet potato  ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... i forgot about the rest of the menu entirely.  i'm not doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. the vegetables were perfectly cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet potato ravioli. then there were scallops. it was one of those dishes that i couldn't comprehend. all i know is i am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer.\",\n",
       " u'had a reservation at 7:15pm but when we arrived we were told we needed to wait 15 mins. that was annoying because that defeats the purpose of making a reservation. after that they found us a tiny table next to two large tables. the atmosphere was loud and cramped. \\n\\nthe food however was great. i had the bouillabaisse which felt like something from louisiana because it had a thick earthy and spicy base. the seafood was fresh and it came with homemade fettuccine.  \\n\\nif the atmosphere had been better i would make myself a regular.',\n",
       " u\"in case you don't know, louisianne's has started serving lunch, the good news is that it is inexpensive and delicious. i had a cup of shrimp bisque that was outstanding, and the grilled chicken po'boy tasted very fresh (the shredded romaine lettuce was much appreciated). the only bad news is the general ambience of the upstairs lunch area . . . rather dark and uninviting.\",\n",
       " u\"i've been to many restaurants in middleton, but this is by far my favorite, and for a number of reasons. the food was excellent: i had a scallop and shrimp special. the service was excellent: seated promptly, waitress prompt, professional and spoke very clearly when it came to the specials. the atmosphere is unique: in the basement of a building, but you wouldn't think so when you're there. piano player, great martini! so when you're in middleton, i suggest you stop here! (and marnie is correct on the raspberry vinaigrette dressing with actual raspberries in it!!)\",\n",
       " u\"think upscale semi-authentic luisiana with a romantic jazz overtone. the food is really quite great, and i would never pass up the catfish. it was blackened and served with a sauce that was indescribable. for a starter i got the stuffed mushrooms with tasty craw fish filling. for desert... yeah that wasn't going to happen i was stuffed! the total bill for me was $37, which was reasonable considering the quality, ambience and how friendly the service was.\\nthe only missing star was that we had trouble finding our server as we were trying to pay our bill (it had already been dropped off but then he was gone!)\",\n",
       " u'yelpers, you let me down! \\n\\ni was on my business trip to wi, and i was very excited about trying this restaurant!  boy, it was a huge disappointment.  \\n\\nhave crab puff pastry as appetizer.  this was pretty decent dish.  the puff pasty came out flaky, just how it should be.  i could taste the crab flavor and almond crisps. it was very delicious. \\n\\ni also ordered the lobster bisque.  bisque was on the salty side, but it was ok with the bread.  i wish i could have stopped my meal here....  \\n\\neveryone on yelp was raving about their raspberry sauce on the house salad.  so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing, and huge disappointment.  it came with this layer of oil, and not enough \"sauce\".  when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil.  i didn\\'t even eat the salad.  \\n\\ni had the steak special of the night and it was not good at all!  the meat was over cooked charred (i like my meat medium rare), the rice was undercooked, it was crunch, and the sauce was not good at all, it did not compliment the dish.   i only ate the shrimp.  it was $35 dish i only picked shrimp from it\\n\\nthe service was soooooo slow that night.  usually i enjoy my meals like these but that night i wanted just get out of there! the server took forever to bring out my dishes and i was getting really impatient.  for the amount of time at was at the table, she didn\\'t come by to check up on me when i needed anything.  ugh.  never again.',\n",
       " u\"was visiting madison for epic training last year and came here with some coworkers.\\n\\nawesome!! everything i had was delicious. tried escargot for the first time and it was wonderful. it was drenched in some savory buttery sauce and topped with a puff pastry...omg. we also tried the crab puffs, they were also delicious.\\n\\ncan't remember exactly what my entree was but it had bacon in it and was great too. the chocolate creme brulee was lovely.\\n\\nback in madison this week and will be going here tomorrow.\",\n",
       " u\"we met another couple here for dinner.  love the ambiance, the smell, the courtesy of the staff.  it's all good.  but the food was especially excellent.  i ordered the pecan catfish.  wow!!!  it was baked to perfection with darkened spices making it the perfect spiciness!!!  i loved it!  veggies were fresh and crisp.  we had an excellent pinot grigio off the list.  the others ordered tenderloin cordon bleu, which was raved about.  there was a shrimp and pork loins special.  that got thumbs up and then another shrimp dish that came on a bed of fresh spinach, which i think she wished she had rice or pasta instead, but she did like it.  love coming here and always recommend it to friends!\",\n",
       " u\"went again and it was amazing as usual. went with a group of coworkers and we started out with escargot, crab puffs and stuffed mushrooms...yum\\n\\nfor the entree's i had some pork masterpiece that was a featured dish and it was divine. for dessert i believe i had the dark chocolate creme brulee again. it was another great experience!\",\n",
       " u\"if you like spicy drinks, try the cajun martini. lots of nice offerings in this cozy place, but cajun/creole cuisine is their forte, especially the seafood. romantic, subterranean dining room unlike anything else you'll find in madison. hard to believe you're in beautiful downtown middleton.\",\n",
       " u\"if you're looking for a nice night out, keep looking...\",\n",
       " u'be careful as you enter this place, the steps are steep as you are going in the basement. also, the carpet on the steps is very dirty, makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like. \\n\\nfour of us had dinner and overall the food is good. service a little slow but very friendly. the place is cramped and the music was loud, so it was difficult to have a conversation at the table. \\n\\nfor the price of the meal you can do much better than this restaurant.',\n",
       " u'awesome food. definitely a good place to eat if it is your first time in madison, wi.',\n",
       " u'after hearing great reviews of louisianne\\'s, my husband and i decided to give it a try.  we went for appetizers and drinks rather than a full meal.  we sat at the bar and had excellent service by the bartender.  when we first arrived it wasn\\'t very crowded, but after 10 minutes the bar was packed with people. the atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano music.\\n\\nwe had the \"combination for 2\" (crab puffs, barbecue shrimp, and stuffed mushrooms) and an order of the mussels for a total of $20.  the mussels were filling since they are in a cream sauce and served with yummy bread.  the combination plate was also excellent.  we were pleasantly full and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for around $55.  \\n\\nit is nice to see a high quality restaurant in middleton!  we will definitely be back again!',\n",
       " u\"my experience at louisianne's was just ok. i have heard a lot of people talk about this place so i gave it a try. i went on a friday night by myself and sat at the bar. not really the type of place you can sit at the bar.  it's very small, there is no television, and hardly any stools. they have live music on the weekends so the place was very loud. my bartender was the only one behind the bar and the restaurant was pretty busy. so, as you can imagine my service was slow. i had the crab puff pastry and bbq shrimp as an appetizer. the crab pastry was very good. the bbq shrimp however were not. i was surprised they left the shell on the shrimp when they serve it. for my main entree i had the coffee crusted chicken and a half order of jambalaya. they wouldn't let me have jambalaya as a side so i had to order half a plate of it if i wanted to try it. the chicken was very moist and flavorful.  a lot sweeter than i had anticipated but good. the jambalaya was very disappointing. overall, i would say it was just ok.\",\n",
       " u'we decided to sit at the bar and have our dinner there so we could listen to the piano player.  we waited a very long time to place a drink order, while watching the bartender stand and converse with other patrons. then, it was an even longer wait to order dinner.  (empty tables all over, so it wasn\\'t due to being busy)  we weren\\'t sure who was supposed to be taking care of us, the bartender or a waitress.   the bartender took our drink order after a long wait, and then after that, finally a waitress came by as asked,  \"i guess you want to hear our specials?\"  she took our order and we never saw her again.  water came half way through our meal from the bartender.  our empty plates sat on our table for 25 minutes.  we felt very unattended to and almost a bother to the staff.  the food is excellent, however, and that just makes it tolerable to go there.  it is not an inexpensive place to eat, and it feels like a place where you should have excellent service.  i got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening.',\n",
       " u'best place in the world, i cant endorse this shit enough. best meal is as follows (although ive had other things here, all good, nothing touches this one)\\n\\napp: crawfish cheesecake, sounds weird but is best of wisconsin and louisiana at once. cheese and crawfish. done. \\n\\nentree: their special filet, basically take everything that is great and put it on a filet. nothing more to say. goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes makes this.\\n\\ndesert: chocolate creme brulee, exactly as it sounds, would choke a homeless person for this (wont be missed).\\n\\nlive music also sometimes.',\n",
       " u'the moment you walk in you are transported into another time and place. they had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out tuesdays through saturdays.\\n\\norder the pecan catfish with the crawfish bbq on top, aka \"maria\\'s special\". it sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. the tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. if you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. presentation was lacking but i don\\'t think that\\'s the point of soul food.  \\n\\nservice is sassy but whole-hearted. we walked in without reservations at 7pm on a friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told \"yeah, if you can find seats\".  we found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. it isn\\'t bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that\\'s better. maria, our bartender who\\'s worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. \\n\\nit\\'s a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. even better if you\\'re prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. try the sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a long island. the crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed.',\n",
       " u\"we had a wonderful experience at louisianne's. we had reservations for dinner, but happened to be seated next to a rather loud group of men. since the restaurant was completely full, we asked if we might be able to be seated in the bar area instead (which was much quieter). they quickly accomodated our request and we had an enjoyable conversation throughout dinner. the food was excellent and a musician softly played piano in the background. the service was prompt, helpful, and friendly. terrific night out!\",\n",
       " u\"quiet, quaint and awesome. the place is tucked away and underground. piano man in the bar area playing jazz and lounge tunes. had escargot, wine and barracuda. at how many other places can you say you have all of those at once, and underground. zero! this place is good. priced well for what you get too. couldn't finish it all.\",\n",
       " u'good food but not authentic and quite overpriced. $38 for 1 entree and 1 dessert served by a snotty teenager? really?',\n",
       " u'wow!  what a find!  outside of the worn carpet on the stairs on the way down, this place is pretty awesome.  very quaint, very, very quaint as you are literally underground.  i loved the feel of the place and the atmosphere.  the food did not disappointment either.  the escargot were absolutely perfect, perfect, one of the best i have yet to have and i have had them in many different place.  for my entree i went with the crayfish etoufee and i am glad i did.  excellent roux, plenty of crayfish, perfectly cooked rice.  excellent overall.  i would give it 5 starts but the dessert menu is very, very pedestrian and not inspired.  would go back again though and again.',\n",

       " u\"we enjoyed our visit to this restaurant however the waitress makes or breaks the evening.  more on that later.\\n\\nwe started at the bar and the bar tender was super cool.  he made a fantastic sazerac, one of the oldest cocktails in the usa.  the four of us admired the decor of the establishment in addition to the fun columns throughout that separated the patrons making it a more private experience.  this place is in a basement  and the columns separate everyone, different than all the open air structures these days.\\n\\nwe had reservations and were seated about 10 minutes late however we were flexible.  the waitress was not very friendly and did not smile.  she was making the motions.  likely tired because it was badger homecoming saturday and they were busy.  we were celebrating a birthday and asked if they did anything special.  she said i don't know and can check.  when she came back she said if you buy a desert, we can put a candle in it.  what??  what restaurant does not do something for a birthday.  oh well, move on...\\n\\neach of us did enjoy our meal.  we had the crawfish cheesecake for appetizer.  it was like a cheesecake?  different and good.  two of us ordered separate specials and the other two ordered items off the menu.  none of us could finish and we enjoyed leftovers the next day.  the food was rich and heavy, comfort food like.  if you are on a diet you'd need to be selective because no calories are spared here.\\n\\nin summary a happy waitress and a little birthday treat and this place would be through the roof!\",\n",

       " u\"dined here recently with friends, and had an enjoyable experience, but not so great food. \\nthe pros:  \\ninviting and cozy atmosphere. \\nreally friendly and attentive service. \\nexcellent live music. \\ngreat cocktails, ok wine list.\\n\\nthe cons:\\nthe food was boring and inconsistent.  we had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  i didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  and everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. i think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  anyway, the appetizers reminded me of pinterest recipes.  \\n\\na big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  that usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  i think we experienced a little of both.  \\n\\nmy husband and i both got the special. it was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  each component sounded good.  however, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \\n\\nthe tenderloin came on skewers.  what?  the shrimp were over cooked.  the meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  everything was covered in some sort of cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of durkee or mccormick.  then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  the whole thing tasted like it was straight off the sysco truck  and reheated. \\n\\none of our companions ordered the filet.  she let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  but it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  i'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \\n\\ndessert was a dark chocolate creme br\\xfbl\\xe9e.  it was dry and pedestrian.  \\n\\nreally i think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but yelp doesn't do half stars, so i'll be generous.  lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  i would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and i could still enjoy them now that i know what to expect.  \\n\\nbut i would not return for dinner.  if i'm going to spend $30 for an entree, i expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.  madison has too many restaurants that offer far superior food to lousiannes, and that's what will drive my future dining decisions.\",\n",
       " u\"just ok because my bar for new orleans food is quite insurmountable!  but i give honest reviews.  whoever is in the kitchen can season food like nobody's business!  it is great food.  seafood was not fresh though and they really do not have bread pudding on the menu!  that tells me that the chef is not from louisiana at all.  prices are too high, way to high!  jambalaya for $20!  ridiculous really.  a pot of that for 10 people cost $20.   but if you want great atmosphere and good food that is just seasoned well, go.  drinks are reasonable and service is fantastic.\",\n",
       " u\"we went here for my sister in law's birthday. i was anxious because my last time here was so unappealing, but this time was a whole different story! we ordered four appetizers to split and all of them were delicious. i had a steak which was cooked to perfection. the service was excellent. the wine they recommended was delicious. we split several desserts and they were delicious as well. i'm still on the fence about the place but our last time there was good enough that i will give it another chance to make my final decision.\",\n",
       " u'my husband and i went to louisianne\\'s recently after we sold our condo and got a middleton chamber of commerce gift certificate from our real estate agent (leslie blum, she\\'s great!).\\n\\nwe wanted to use the opportunity to have a special date night and go somewhere a bit more upscale than we usually do. having never been to louisianne\\'s in the 5 years that i\\'ve lived in middleton, i suggested we try it out.\\n\\ni give the atmosphere of this place a solid five stars. although it has an rather bland looking storefront, the inside of the restaurant is anything but. you walk into louisianne\\'s and immediately head downstairs. it\\'s all stone and looks like you\\'re walking into a cool cave or something. it\\'s dark, but there\\'s a lot of ambiance. i\\'ve been to new orleans, and it definitely has that sort of vibe to it. it\\'s romantic, fun, and not what you\\'d expect from the outside. i felt like we were on vacation while we were there. also, there was a live jazz band playing and they were really rocking. it was awesome!\\n\\nwe went at about 8pm on a friday night had to wait about ten minutes for a table, which was fine. while we waited, we ordered drinks at the bar and watched the band. i had red wine, and my husband had jameson on the rocks. \\n\\nwe were seated and ordered the pecan crab cakes as an appetizer. they were good, probably just 3 stars though, as they tasted a lot like other midwestern crab cakes that i\\'ve had before. they were heavy on bread and light on crab...with a lot of old bay seasoning. again, they weren\\'t bad at all, but not spectacular.\\n\\nnext, we ordered some more wine and our entrees (more on those in a minute).  we were given a choice of soup or salad with our entrees and we each ordered soup. they had two soups of the day: a shrimp -corn chowder (which i got), and a tomato-based pulled pork stew that was like chilli (which my husband had). both soups were fantastic! definitely 5 stars for the soup. \\n\\ni\\'ll take a minute here to comment that i enjoy going to traditional restaurants from time to time, places where soup/salad and bread are included with your meal instead of everything being ala-cart. (it reminds me of dining in wisconsin supper clubs as a child). by the way, the bread basket was delicious and was quickly replenished by the waitress after we ate all of the bread within 30 seconds of sitting down because it was warm and toasty (and served with soft butter) and we were starving! \\n\\nonto the entrees! my husband absolutely loved his dish. he claims that it was possibly \"the best thing i\\'ve ever had in a restaurant\". he chose the coffee roasted chicken, which featured a bed of (homemade) fettuccine topped with a coffee-crusted bone-in grilled chicken breast, in a \"hazelnut, orange, ricotta sauce\". i think there was spinach in it too. the pasta was perfectly al dente, the grilled chicken moist, and the sauce was rich and creamy. it almost reminded me of a thai peanut sauce, but with hazelnuts instead. although it sounded like something that could become cloyingly sweet, it was not. it had a nice subtle umami essence in addition to the sweetness. delicious. 5 stars.\\n\\nthe reason that louisianne\\'s is not getting a five star review from me, however, is due to my entree, which i felt was very underwhelming. we don\\'t eat pasta at home for health reasons, so i usually get it when we go somewhere nice as a special treat. i chose the tasso and shrimp fettuccine because it was homemade pasta, and because it featured authentic new orleans style ingredients (for the unfamiliar, tasso is basically spicy ham). the shrimp and tasso pieces in my pasta were well-cooked, but they were sparse. the dish also featured mushrooms, and they were fabulous...probably the best part. however, the pasta was supposed to have a \"creole mustard cream sauce\", and it didn\\'t really. the sauce was very light, and had little flavor. it was kind of sad, because i was really hoping to be wowed and i wasn\\'t. i\\'d say my item was probably 3 stars, and would have been awesome if only the sauce had been a bit more pronounced and flavorful. \\n\\nthe service was adequate. nothing remarkable in either a good or a bad way.\\n\\nsummary: i\\'d definitely return. i think lousianne\\'s etc. is a decently nice restaurant overall, and is great for special occasions. their primary issue, from both my own experience as well as the reviews on yelp, seems to be consistency. some menu items are fabulous, and others are meh. the major problem with this is that louisianne\\'s  menu is at a price point where people only go occasionally...so the restaurant basically has one shot to impress, and if they fail at that, guests won\\'t return for a second chance. i think this explains why the yelp reviews for louisianne\\'s are so polarized.',\n",
       " u\"came here based upon yelp reviews. i was expecting a dive place, like all the other cajun places i've been to, but that's not this place. dark mood lighting in the basement of an old house. small menu and very pricey. not what i was expecting at all. i ordered the blackened catfish and a beer. the catfish and the jambalaya  were the two least expensive entrees in the low $20's per each. \\n\\npleasantly surprised by the large portion of grilled vegies and handmade mashed potatoes that came with the catfish. amazing flavor and worth the money. the menu didn't mention the sides included. friend ordered the jambalaya and let me try it. the blackened catfish was way better.\",\n",
       " u\"i love this place.  i love the ambiance, the food, and the drinks.  it's even better when they have a lounge singer in the background.\",\n",
       " u'this is the first marriott i have ever been a little disappointed in.  i thought initially it was going to be an amazing hotel, since i totally screwed up on the reservation (made it for the wrong day) and the girl at the desk was so cool to work with me and get me a room when the whole place was fully booked.  \\n\\nexcept, the place was fully booked for the \"little miss junior miss\" pageant, or some other stupid name like that, which meant hell for andy and i as the entire place was infested with pre-teen beauty queens, their scary domineering mothers, and other random siblings that came along for the ride.  can you say o. m. g.  \\n\\nnow, normally this would be a non-issue, as we are rarely in our hotel room except to sleep and once in the room you couldnt hear a lot of hallway noise.  but this 10 story hotel had a grand total of 2 elevators, which were packed at all hours of the day with girls in gowns and tiaras, groups of girls in heavy makeup, or wet children dripping from the hotel pool. this made getting in and out a bit challenging since we were on the top floor. \\n\\ni realize this is hardly marriotts fault that the junior misses had descended upon middleton, since they are just trying to turn a buck in this economy, but the design of this place was not user friendly in the slightest.  also, hey brilliant idea guys, put the pool across the hall from the elevator and then make that whole area tile so people track water out and the floor is slippery!  nice.  and also understaff the dining area so noone can get in and eat because there is noone to clean off the tables and take your order.  nice planning!\\n\\nman, that whole experience left a bad taste.  the worst part will be trying to convince andy to stay at a marriott ever again as he is just now getting relief from the migrane he got on saturday.',\n",
       " u\"what a mess of a hotel. i guess that maybe i grew up in an era where the marriott name meant class and luxury. \\ni can't blame marriott for the fact that the hotel was hosting the little miss (jon benet) america contest. the hotel was overran with 6 year olds wearing make up and donning skimpy outfits. it's disturbing that parent's lives are so unfulfilled that they have to dress their children like cocktail waitresses at a seedy bar. \\nthe hotel was totally booked. you had ten floors worth of rooms, but yet the hotel only had two elevators. it was pretty annoying to wait 15 minutes every time you wanted to go up to your room. \\nand the kicker was on sunday morning when we wanted to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant. the hotel had nobody on duty to bus tables, so while it was obvious that the restaurant was half empty, but there was a 15 minute wait to be seated. of course the hostess acted like an office temp, with a bad attitude. that was a perfect ending to our hell stay at the marriott-madison west. i couldn't check out of that hotel fast enough. \\nin the future, i would rather stay at a hotel with sticky sheets, that rents it's rooms by the hour than ever stay at a marriott again.\",\n",
       " u\"had an okay stay here at this marriott (which looks to have been an embassy suites at one time, judging by the interior).  i was traveling on business, and appreciated the quiet rooms and very comfy bed.  \\n\\nsome of the interior could use some updates, especially in the bathroom.  one major annoyance was that the blackout drapes were for decoration only and couldn't be closed all the way to make the room dark.  what a pain!!\\n\\nother than that, friendly staff and mediocre breakfast in the morning.  there really isn't anything around of note (all chain restaurants and office buildings), so i think on my next trip i'll drive a little extra to stay in madison and bypass middleton!\",\n",
       " u'my boyfriend and i pricelined a room for our anniversary trip this weekend. we were super excited to get a \"3.5star plus\" hotel for a really good deal. it\\'s too bad there were so many things that worked against making this a truly awesome hotel: \\n\\n- the fact that there is no carpet between the pool and the elevators, so the floor is often dangerously wet. \\n- the fact that the bathroom door opened onto the toilet - you had to sidestep it in order to close the door. \\n- the fact that the night desk clerk, when counting the register, set the cash tray on the counter nearest the customers. it would have been an easy, quick jaunt out the front door with it.\\n- the 20min it took to get extra towels\\n- the empty ice bin in the vending area\\n- the desk clerk who came out to talk to customers while still chewing food\\n\\nby far the worst offense was the fact that check-out time was noon, yet housekeeping tried to enter our room at eight in the morning. i can\\'t imagine it\\'s that hard to find out which rooms are ready for cleaning, and which are not. \\n\\nthe only real pro was the bedding, which was luxe and fluffy. not even close to being worth the $2800 they sell it for, but fun for a night. \\n\\nthe room ended up being cheap for the name-brand, but more satisfaction could have been found from a lesser-name place. lesson learned for next time.',\n",
       " u\"i got my room off priceline for 75, so i was happy with the price. i would not pay the 150 the hotel was asking for. the room was clean and pretty big. the toliet wouldnt flush, but after stopping by the front desk it was taken care of. no free breakfast, so we didnt eat at the hotel. we didn't use the pool, so nothing to say about that. i do agree with the other reviews that the design of the building is not good. there was a wedding going on the one night and it was pretty loud late into the evening. good location, right off the highway. we were into madison in 10 miuntes.\",\n",
       " u'although most of the workers were very pleasant, the customer service by one female during check-in as well as another at the breakfast buffet was so unprofessional that i will not be a patron at this location again. after complaining of the rude service, for which we were given the excuse of a busy weekend, we asked to be connected with management, who never followed up. unacceptable!',\n",
       " u\"i can't stand to sit here and read these horrible reviews. \\nwhen my son was receiving treatments for spine/ brain cancer, at uw hospital, we did not  have many choices at that time of where to stay during and between treatments. my son would become so ill from all the radiation plus chemo, and the radiation treatments were at two 6 hour intervals every day, so we couldn't venture far most days.\\naltho we had spent time at the ronald mcdoanld house, after a time i needed to make my son feel less a patient and more like a celebrity for a day. so i decided to take a paycheck, and chose a day between visits to get a suite at the marriott west. \\naltho my son had to use a mobile iv unit, and was scarred on his  head from radiation burns, this marriott was most accomodating and incredible.\\nwe had a gorgeous suite, exquistie room service and gracious attentions.\\nthese attentions were not triggered by my sons illness, but sincerely born from true proffesionalism and great training. \\nthis is a beautiful establishment, and i personally cannot stand the voices of spoiled whiners on these previous reviews. \\nthis marriott will hold dear to me always and is worthy of your travel time relaxing time, and most of all your needs no matter to what extent.\\nstop being so ridiculously spoiled and realize. \\nthis marriott is above average.\",\n",
       " u\"was here for a gala at the adjoining conference center.  service was terrible. the waitress kept slamming food and drinks on the  table. she only brought dinner for half the table and the rest had to wait for 15 minutes. one of the guests had to wait about 20 minutes for the meal. horrible!\\ni've been to many marriotts before and hold a frequent visitor card, but this one has been the worst experience so far.\\n\\ni know this isn't a review that completely reflects the hotel or any restaurants inside it, but the fact that this service was under the marriott name prompted this review and r\",\n",
       " u'before i booked here, i was about to stay at a crappy hotel off the highway that look like it was about to fall apart. i just happen to browse online on priceline and got this place book. i was already happy at this point that i am staying at a marriott because i have always had great experiences at all the marriotts across the country, but what happens next makes me love this location even more. i am extremly happy i didnt let some of the previous reviews deter me from booking here. when i arrived, my check in process was easy, the front desk was friendly, and i was able to check in early (which i was on a 16 hour drive cross country so i was ready to rest). my room was clean, the bathroom is immaculate, and it had everything i needed. even the smallest things such as hair dryer, ethernet wire, and the ginger orange smell hair products made this stay very pleasant. i wanted to bring my work computer up to my room and the front desk gentleman was very helpful in assisting me with all my questions and helping with the cart so i can take it upstairs. when i travel, i dont expect hotel staff to wait on my hand and feet and i am not a needy guest, as long as they are professional and willing to help when i ask for it, i am satisfied with my stay. i asked for a different coffee maker since it wasnt working and they brought me another right to my room within a few minutes, thats what i call attentive and prompt service. all in all, i highly recommend this marriottt.',\n",
       " u\"booked the room on priceline for our anniversary getaway.  2 days before we were to leave i called to check on the reservation.  i was transferred to the, hands down, single most rude man in customer service.  he told me to call back when there were not kids in the background and when i had my reservation number because he didn't want to look it up by last name.  i called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager.  she was wonderful and apologized and i felt better about staying there, knowing that not everyone was as rude as that man.\\n\\nwe checked in and the man at the desk wished us a happy anniversary and informed us that we would be staying in the honeymoon sweet and had access to the concierge floor and snacks were being served.  every time we saw him that night he asked if there was anything that he could do to make our stay better.  what a surprise and proof that good customer service does exist!  \\n\\nthe bedding was very nice and the housekeeping staff was always so nice.\\n\\nwe had a wonderful time and we will stay there again!\",\n",
       " u\"i stay here for several days every year for a conference that's held in this hotel. i've always had decent service here and the rooms are average size but clean! my only wish is that they had rooms with kitchenettes! for economical reasons i like to keep food in the room and it's frustrating staying somewhere all week and having to have the front desk microwave your left-overs for you. they did, however, move a mini-fridge into my room at my request which was nice. also, really great restaurants in the area which i have been very pleased with!\",\n",
       " u'it\\'s hard to believe this is a marriott property.  i\\'ve logged over 50 nights at this hotel so i think i\\'m decently qualified to offer a balanced review.  this last stay will be my last overall.  although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  i could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren\\'t major, just a little annoying. concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.  it greatly lacks attention to detail.  i frequently have to call for things that have been left out of the room (missing hairdryer, washcloths, double body wash but no shampoo...and so on).   the linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  i am a platinum member of marriott and am always booked into a king room.  this time, they put me in a room with 2 doubles for no reason.  i immediately changed rooms and the tv did not work.  i then plugged my laptop into the lamp and it made a loud \"pop\" and blue sparks came out.  all of the power in the room was then knocked out.  this is unacceptable, as the wiring in that lamp was obviously faulty & dangerous.  i was lucky my computer was not fried.  the last straw came when i killed a large fly in the room with the first thing i could grab, which was the paper breakfast menu.  i then crumpled the menu and threw it away.  the next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  i know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where i crumpled it up.  outrageous.  anyone who would think this is acceptable service is out of their mind.  i will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers.  during a single stay, i have never heard so many staff say, \"i apologize for that\".  sorry isn\\'t enough, i\\'ll be trying the hilton garden inn next time.  good service speaks for itself and does not require apologies.',\n",

       " u'i would imagine things would be different if i stayed here when they did not have a convention in town but i did!\\n\\nchecked in to a room on the 6th floor (out of 10).  i had pounding and banging all round me due to remodeling.  they did finish by late afternoon but the hallways were full of beds and other room furniture.  besides being unsightly, that wasn\\'t a big deal.  my problems started at night  and the next morning.   \\n\\nwhen the meeting in one of the ballrooms ended apparently most of the people didn\\'t have enough!  because of the set up of he hotel every room in the hotel faces the bar.  even though the bar is on the ground floor the noise funnels up and it becomes a big echo chamber!  noise continued until about 1am.  i\\'m not sure if i was pissed because i couldn\\'t sleep or if i was just jealous that i sounded like they were having a lot of fun!\\n\\nthe next morning was a joke!  trying to leave wad impossible.  why they would build a hotel with 10 floors and only 2 elevators is beyond me!  with people checking out, going to breakfast or just moving around it was impossible to get on an elevator unless you were on the top 2 floors.  people were lined up on every floor trying to get somewhere.  the smart people started getting on using the \"up\" button and just going for a ride.  i finally have up and lugged my bags down six floors of stairs. what i found has a huge line of others doing the same.  i felt like a refugee!!!  some women a head of me were having troubles because they had multiple bags.  eventually one of them fell.... i wasn\\'t pretty.  \\n\\ni found that this hotel looked nice, had a nice pool.  but i would never stay here on a weekend or when it was busy ever again!  they need to find a away to build another elevator and bite the bullet and shut the bar down much earlier or move it into one of the ballrooms.',\n",
       " u'***this marriott definitely feels dated and it is not in downtown madison; it is a comfortable enough hotel, service is good and room rates are reasonable; however, the hotel has kind of a depressing look and feel to it; it needs an update***\\n\\nthis marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel.  airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  this marriott has a similar look as the philadelphia airport renaissance.  both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  you do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\\n\\nunfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  the lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  the rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\\n\\nthe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  the food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  in addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\\n\\nthis marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  the rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  the room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  the shower was fine.\\n\\nthis marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a marriott rewards gold or platinum member.  the suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\\n\\non weekends, marriott rewards gold and platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per saturday and sunday or 750 marriott rewards points per saturday and sunday.  this is a new nationwide marriott benefit for marriott rewards gold and platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  i have been to a few properties (santa clara marriott, minneapolis marriott city center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\\n\\nthe front desk was nice and helpful.\\n\\nroom rates are good, but this hotel is not in downtown madison.  it is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to madison though.  however, i am not sure if getting to downtown madison on a wisconsin football game day is challenging.\\n\\nthis marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  this hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  it is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.  if you are a marriott rewards gold or platinum member, they do treat you well here and maybe even better than some marriott properties.\\n\\nthis marriott has its own free parking lot.  it is easy finding an open space.',\n",
       " u\"i. like. this. hotel. if no shuttle is available to pick you up from the airport, they pay for your cab. the front desk staff is quick and attentive which is exactly what you want after a day of air travel. room service was very friendly and the food was yum. the toilet handle was misbehaving and while it took some time for engineering to fix it, they were beyond apologetic and did all of the things you'd expect a good hotel to do - either offer a room change/upgrade or other free stuff. the hotel is in middleton so don't book a room here and then complain that it's not downtown. look at a map. how is it the hotel's fault that you are in need of additional iq points? \\n\\nso many yelpers like to complain about every dumb, little thing without understanding that it's not about perfection, it's about how a business responds to a problem. this marriott is not as modern as some others, but i'd pick a clean room and good service over some spiffy wallpaper and berber carpet any day.\",\n",
       " u\"i was torn on how to rank this. there is part of me that wants to go a little lower, but the management on a couple occasions and the general kindness of the concierge lounge attendants made up an extra star. \\n\\nthis marriott is about the level of a nicer courtyard marriott. the only way our stay was bearable was because we were upgraded to suite. if we had not had the door to separate our bedroom from living space, we would have been unable to rest with all of the noise coming up from the atrium..and we were on the 9th floor. a cocktail reception on a tuesday night in the vast open space of the lobby was incredibly loud, but no problem due to our suite.   however a gathering of incredibly loud, rude teenagers whose director used a bullhorn at 9pm at night to address the entire hotel of teenagers was the last straw for us. we had a two week reservation...we left 5 nights in.  \\n\\nadditional issues with this property: the concierge lounge is very, very limited. every other marriott (including most courtyards) have coffee and tea in the lounge throughout the day, not to mention during the cocktail/dessert hours. at this one, there is none during the day, and, most frustrating, in the evening you have to ask the concierge to provide you with a cup of coffee or hot water. not at all convenient for a business traveller who takes calls in the lounge. plus the coffee is not high quality. the attendants were very kind, but just not a well executed lounge in comparison to other properties.\\n\\ni also want to thank the management who alerted housekeeping when we were leaving in the morning to service our room for the last couple days we were there. prior to that, the room was not being serviced until about 2:30pm, which is our daughters naptime, and she was along with us on this trip. it was a little frustrating.  as for the actual service, it was hit or miss. one day was great, replenished our towels, toiletries, took out the trash. another time our daughters blankets were thrown into a ball in the corner of the bedroom, zero toiletries replenished, and two of her toys that were drying in the bathroom were thrown away. a call for extra towels went without towels ever materializing one night.  also, the in-room fridge does not fully work, and our hummus, juices, and other snacks were spoiled. \\n\\ni get that this is the area's biggest conference center, so maintaining business is not a problem for them. however, for those of us who travel frequently and experience many marriott properties, this one does not come up to scratch, but again, the friendly demeanor of most employees we encountered did help the spotty service of this hotel.\",\n",
       " u'i was there for the wisconsin bar.  so you can just imagine how tense all things were.  the staff was really friendly and understanding of hundreds of law grads flooding their venue.  \\n\\nthe falling water restaurant is a convenient locale and located in the lobby.  if i had no vehicle, i would eat there and be okay with it.  i ordered a sandwich for lunch and it was a bit \"buttery.\"  i do like that you can order your food ahead of time and have it ready at a particular time.  \\n\\nthe rooms are very typical.  nothing outstanding, but it is nice to have a window to look at something besides a brick wall.  you get a parking lot view but you get motion.  \\n\\nthe banquet rooms were gorgeous.  the hotel is nicely decorated.  it even has a small waterfall hiding the elevators.  i was annoyed by the parking situation.  it is downhill.  not a huge hill, but enough to make the walk precarious during these icy times.  perhaps a little more salt could be expended for visitors.  the location is nice as it is near restaurant and a mall.  forget something at home?  there is even a costco within ten minutes driving.  it is about 1/4 mile off the beltline and just outside of madison (by one highway exit).  \\n\\nif you want to stay in madison but avoid the high prices of downtown and the congestion of rush hour, this is the place to be.',\n",
       " u\"this review of the madison marriott west focuses on the group event services of this facility and not the guest rooms.  i recently attended an evening board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.\\n\\nthe majority of the sales and catering staff at the marriott were wonderful to work with.  this was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  the responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  there were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  on the day of the event, they checked in on us frequently and promptly addressed any concerns our group had.\\n\\nwe had some problems with the reservations agents indicating that no rooms were available at the conference rate.  the other problem has to do with the layout of the conference rooms.  there is one conference room (the monona room) located by the front desk, far away from all the other meeting rooms.  on the day before the event, you guessed it; the marriott staff moved us to that room.  the calendar of events is not conspicuous, so on the day of the event, all the conference attended entered the facility through the conference center doors and wandered about searching for the monona room.\\n\\nlike most conference facility, the food was a mixed bag.\\n\\nthings i liked:\\n* i enjoyed the caesar salad served with lunch with fresh greens (no iceberg lettuce), tangy dressing and herbed croutons that did not go overboard with the salt or garlic.\\n\\n* other than the overcooked noodles, the penne pasta with mushroom, spinach, goat cheese, pine nuts and roasted red pepper cream was a well-executed dish.\\n\\n* while the filling had a bit too much citrus flavor, kudos to the kitchen staff for serving us a cannoli with a crunchy shell, a rarity on the conference food circuit.\\n\\nthings i didn't:\\n* the rigatoni with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and arriabiatta sauce lacked the finesse of the aforementioned penne pasta dish.  with its mushy noodles, overcooked sauce and under-seasoned sausage, there was little to like.\\n\\n* if you enjoy a heavy does of garlic powder on bread with the texture of a teething biscuit, you would love the garlic bread served with the pasta course.\\n\\n* my least favorite dish was toasted cheese sandwich served during the planning session the day before the conference.  for $14.95, i expected aged cheddar served on gently grilled slices of artisan sourdough bread.  what i received was very different.  served barely warm, the bread was soaked in butter and toasted to a brick-like texture that left cuts on the roof of my mouth.  the institutional grade cheddar and provolone cheese had started to congeal by the time the staff served it to me.  the server did not check in with us because she didn't want to interfere with our meeting, preventing me from sending this dish back for a replacement.  the roasted tomato soup, though cool, was the redeeming feature of my meal.\\n\\noverall, the experience with the marriott madison west was a-ok, based on the positive interactions with the staff, which offset the spotty food quality.\",\n",
       " u'it\\'s loud, the employees are not friendly, and you simply can\\'t trust them for a wake up call... i didn\\'t even get an \"i\\'m sorry\" when they entered a 6am wake up call for 7am!\\n\\nand i\\'ve been marriott platinum for 10 years! if they can\\'t be courteous to their elite guests, how are they to everyone else? skip this hotel...',\n",

       " u\"got invited here by a few friends the other night. it's primarily a softball/volleyball/recreational center, although i spent my time inside in the bar.\\n\\nthe bar area is massive and includes a stage and dance floor. when i inquired as to whether there were ever any bands, i was told that they only do karaoke every so often. seems like a waste of a nice entertainment area.\\n\\nvery limited taps; most beverages are served in bottles and cans. prices are super cheap; tall boys of most anything run in the $2.25 - $2.50 range.\\n\\nvery limited menu; only a few easy-to-prepare items.\\n\\nbest suited for grabbing a cold one after a game of softball than as a destination point. \\n\\nthe bartenders were friendly and super fast - a bonus in my book. thanks to gretchen & staci for the excellent service.\",\n",
       " u'i\\'ve been playing softball at bowling green for, well, let\\'s just say \"a long time\".  while it\\'s not a modern athletic facility, it\\'s got a niche market.  if you enjoy playing ball, having a cold beer, and having fun with some friends - this is a good place for a league.  the umpires are excellent - i\\'ve known a few for many years and they do a great job.  \\n\\nthe fields are smaller, but \"good bats\" are limited, keeping home runs down a little (but it feels good to get one - it still goes plenty far!).\\n\\ni hope they stick around for a long time - i love playing there on tuesday nights.',\n",
       " u\"i have shopped here for about 2 yrs now. the quality is fairly consistent and so is the high price. =p  the selection is wide, and during holidays, they push out special desert cakes.  i have yet to try their bread and chocolates though.\\n\\nthings i've tried:\\ncandied pecan cookie, chocolated-coated mascarpone cookie, morning bun, almond croissant, french cheese braids, chocolate truffle cake, etc. \\n\\nthe big pluses are the right amount of butter and sugar in their pastries. it is never too sweet or too oily.  the right use of butter also gives a desirable texture as well.  the cakes have very fine layering (4 layers over 2.5in height), which makes the flavors of the cream blends very well with the cakes when you warm it up to room temperature.\",\n",
       " u\"after spending a month in europe, i was very excited to come back to madison and rediscover clasen's european bakery. though the shop is about ten times bigger than any bakery in europe, you can find some pretty authenic goods, and the kitchen is said to be staffed by german master bakers. of course, nothing tasted quite the same as the real european thing, and you are sure to find some pretty standard american bakery there as well.\\n\\nclasen's doesn't look like too much when you first walk in, but who cares when you have a warehouse of good to gawk at? there are shelves and shelves full of cookies, desserts, breads, sweetbreads, etc! everything i've tried is quality and very fresh. be sure to come early for the best selection.\\n\\nprices are decent, but the staff can be grumpy. there is ususally a sale or special deal to look for on one of the store's front tables, and a wide selection of holiday items. also don't miss the sampling area near the back.\",\n",
       " u\"this one is a big fail. after having been told numerous times that i had to go to clasen's bakery, i finally went. what i found was a large room filled with unappetizing, boring baked goods. nothing in here did i want, or have any desire to try. there were loaves of bread, but the selection is better at whole foods or willy street co-op. the cookies had the panache and flair of the garbage that is sold in starbucks. chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar? what is so european about any of this? greenjim h said about high prices? i am not sure what he bought, i saw nothing that would be classified as high priced. the pastries were as boring as the cookies, danish, morning bun?\\n\\ni don't know how this classifies as a european bakery. this is an average bakery, in a very far out of the way place. i am sure there are better places to go to grab a loaf of bread and a cookie.\",\n",

       " u\"looks like i'm going to be a dissenting opinion about the hilton garden inn.  i've stayed in madison plenty of times for work, and overall, this is the nicest hotel that i've stayed at.  pros: staff are very nice and friendly.  hotel has gym, pool, and business center at no additional cost.  you know how some hotels have that teeny tiny kiosk to print your boarding pass, and that's all you can do?  there are 2 computers hooked up to printers so can you do real tasks like check your email, yelp, etc.  the beds are very comfortable.  it shocked me how nice they were.  bathrooms have stone countertops and something heating the mirror, so that after a shower your mirror is still usable, not all fogged up.  someone had their thinking hat on.  the hotel is walkable to several restaurants & i think they provide room service, but they will also help you order from a nearby restaurant if you arrive late in the evening.\\n\\nfor a hotel this size, they do a really good job with breakfast.  it's a buffet with the usual cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, and hot food.  but they really go an extra mile on the eggs, and every egg dish is cooked to order.  whether you want 1 scrambled egg or full omelette, they'll make it for you fresh, give you a table tent number, and then bring it to you.\\n\\ni have 2 more trips this year to madison, and hope i'm staying here again!\",\n",

       " u\"three sisters is one of the best breakfast joints in the madison area. for me the two best things are the hash browns and the omelettes. like all the other raters, i think their hash browns are perfect. their omelettes are not the fluffy kind. they are flat-cooked, sheet-style, folded around all the good stuff you specify. this is the kind of omelette i prefer, and for this style theirs is one of the best i've had. beyond that, the service is super unpretentious and friendly. their cinnamon rolls are big, soft, and without the density i favor. their pancakes are more spongy than i like. but you should still try them, it's just a matter of style, and everything here is done with sincerity and consistency. you will find something you like enough to keep going back, especially since their prices are so reasonable.\",\n",
       " u'in our opinion three sisters will appeal to certain people and not to others.   some will like it\\'s laid back, small town, dinette atmosphere.  nothing fancy, good food, large portions.   others will also enjoy the good food but will be displeased with the lack of space, mismatched dinning wear,  less than average coffee, barely toasted toast and the \"greasy spoon\" environment of the building.   \\nsome will see 4 or five stars, go there and say \"dead on.  loved the place.\"   others will wonder how someone gave them more than three.\\nwe went back and didn\\'t enjoy our food as much as we did the last time and the coffee was not very good.  also we thought the prices were higher.   \\nanyway, love it or leave it, it is a three star restaurant in our book.',\n",

       " u'middleton sport bowl is kind of a mixed bag.  i\\'ll briefly break down how i gauge them (i\\'ve been many times, both before and after the renovation)\\n\\nfacility:  great environment, a reasonable number of lanes (although not as many as other alleys in the area), a roomy bar with tvs for the sports games, and an upstairs that has both pool as well as a rental area that hosts private functions or tournaments.\\n\\ncost:  fairly cheap if you go on open bowling nights, i think it\\'s around $1 or $2 a game plus shoes.  i\\'m sure it\\'s hiked up otherwise.  open bowling is usually after 9pm during the week and not a bad option.  we used to go on thursdays which seems to be a good night for them.\\n\\nfood:  it\\'s typical bar food.  they have good cheese curds, and the usual fare that you\\'d see at an alley.  nothing to write home about but if you\\'re in the mood for a greasy burger you probably won\\'t go wrong.\\n\\nservice:  i cannot stand the people that work at the counter.  there\\'s a couple of older guys (50-60+) who obviously hate life and want to project that on you when you\\'re there.  everytime i\\'ve gone in i\\'ve tried to be courteous and polite, and asked simple basic questions like \"i\\'d like to get a lane, there\\'s 3 of us and we all need shoes\" etc, etc.  these guys first look at you like you walked into the wrong bar, and then respond with gruff, 2 second answers that doesn\\'t help either party move the process along.  it\\'s really irritating because i\\'ve gone to this alley off and on for probably about 10 years or so, and it\\'s always been like that.  the bartenders, when you get a woman, are usually friendly and don\\'t share the same attitude.\\n\\npersonally i\\'m more of a schwoeglers guy, but their prices for open bowling are more expensive and the atmosphere is noiser, so sport bowl sometimes wins out.',\n",

       " u'i\\'m not reviewing this place as a bowling alley, since i don\\'t have the expertise to know what constitutes a good bowling experience.  if the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it\\'s fine.\\n\\nthis review is all about the food.  which, if you can\\'t tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty tasty.  to start, the cheese curds are required eating.  i think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious when fresh.  make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point.  \\n\\nwhen you think bar food, you think burgers.  and the burgers at the sport bowl are excellent.  not only are they excellent, they are fairly priced as well.  at lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  i can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful \"contented, weighed down, and fuzzy-brained\" feeling afterwards.  \\n\\na quick rundown on other items i\\'ve tried: the meatball sub was so-so, but huge.  go to gino\\'s a mile away if you\\'re craving meatballs.  the turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.  the patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  the pizza is decent, with a crust that tastes like pizza hut\\'s deep dish.  the fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.  the \"philly\" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.\\n\\nthe best part about the sport bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease, you can pop over to willy west next door to get an organic hippie-smoothie.  but it will probably cost more than your entire meal here.',\n",
       " u\"great burgers, sad fish. we do a weekly managers meeting and everyone takes turns choosing the location. one of the guys choose the madison sports bowl. i ordered the fish, when the food came to the table i saw beautiful hand pattied burgers, hand dipped onion rings, then came my fish. sad flat, boring, breading right off the sysco truck. what a disappointment. today we made a second trip and i ordered the burger and onion rings. i'm very happy!\",\n",
       " u\"ever since their renovation, this place has knocked it out of the park.  this is the place to go for a cold beer after a softball game.  hungry?  no problem!  their menu is extensive and everything that i've had has been excellent.\\n\\ni especially recommend the pizza - you don't expect great pizza from a bowling alley, but they do a great job.  it's a favorite of ours.  their burgers are top notch as well.  i haven't had the gyros, but a friend of mine raves about them.  the kids menu is great - my little guy destroyed their mini corn dogs.\\n\\nthe staff is very friendly and helpful.  the owners put a lot of hard work and time into this place, and it shows.  on a cool summer evening, you can't beat sitting out on the patio with a cold one.\",\n",
       " u\"this is my go-to library, because it's closest to home. there always seems to be a decent selection of the new releases, and i can always get in and out quickly. plus, i can always go grab a slice of pie next door at hubbard!\",\n",
       " u\"one of our first restaurant visits when we moved here.  we have since learned to avoid any restaurant a local recommends.  menu was full of bland comfort food.  wife had chicken and dumplings that tasted like they came out of a can  my steak was tough and flavorless.  restaurant has been in the same location for about 100 years and it shows, it's badly in need of a remodel.  entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty.  i could smell the bathrooms ten feet away and when i had to visit they were even worse, layer over layer of dirt.  where's the health inspector.  service was extremely poor, especially considering we were the only people in the place.  i guess the highschooler that was serving us was too busy talking on her cell phone to help us.\",\n",
       " u\"used to be a classic. however, it's come under new ownership and everything has suffered across the board. average service, below average food and terrible atmosphere.\\n\\nneeds a shot in the arm because it'd be a shame to see a classic wisconsin supper club disappear.\",\n",
       " u\"i wanted to like it, i really did. the stamm house is walking distance from home, so i figured we had to try it... \\n\\nfirst off, let me say that the atmosphere is typical old(emphasis on the old)-school wisconsin restaurant. wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and god awful seventies music piped in. when we walked in(at six on a saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. the waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, i realized with disappointment. if i want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, i'd be cooking at home. dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. it also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, i could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \\n\\nthe bf ordered the fried walleye,and i the beef tips moutarde. his french onion soup was decent, but my salad was lacking. when the meal arrived, i was so excited because i was starved. i picked up a piece of beef with my fork and bit down into tender, juicy...fat. fatty fatty fatness. ewww. i did the not-so-sexy-spit-it-onto-the-side-plate maneuver. all right. every now and then you get a fatty piece of meat in a dish. a girl can move on. my next bite was better, and although the sauce was decent, it was nothing fabulous. i was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty. you know when you get that cheap meat that is mostly sinew and fat. *sigh* i'm done. i pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato. \\n\\nto give credit, the waiter noticed i wasn't eating the dish, and asked me if something was wrong. i told him, and he offered to get me something else, which i declined(by the time it was made, chris would have been done with his dish). later, he also offered a free dessert, which we really didn't want. he ended up knocking almost half off my dish, which was appropriate, i think. \\n\\nover all, it just wasn't enjoyable. i could have gotten over picking a bad dish if the experience itself was nice, but it wasn't. average at best. the waiter was decent and tried to be accommodating, but on the whole, it was just sub-par. i left wishing that i had picked another spot to spend my hard earned date-night budget! i realize that a place like this isn't going to be gourmet, but i've had much better casual dining experiences...for less money!\",\n",
       " u'2-stars may be a bit generous if we\\'re just measuring food quality.  \\n\\nquick-n-dirty review: stamm house features a lot of character, history, and good service.  unfortunately, that\\'s about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\\n\\ndetailed review: our fish fry crew decided to give stamm house a try after we\\'d read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they\\'ve completely missed the mark when it comes to the stamm house.  not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\\n\\nwe sauntered in to the stamm house at around 5:45 on friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  the bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of new glarus nakeds and a spotted cow.  after downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - naked went empty, and there wasn\\'t any more left.  drat.\\n\\nafter downing a second round of beers (cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  so, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she\\'d have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\\n\\nwe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  the bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \"standard-from-the-bag\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  they arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\\n\\nthe curds were sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  i don\\'t think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn\\'t eat them.  disgusting.  and the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \\n\\nthe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  it really made for a bad first impression.  so, we ordered some whiskey old fashioned sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \\n\\nour table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\\n\\ndinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  first bite of the fish?  ugh - it tasted awful.  extremely fishy flavor (and i love fish).  think \"stinky nj ocean shore line flavor\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  no sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \\n\\nso, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  that helped a bit, but it still wasn\\'t an enjoyable fish fry.  the fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  if only it weren\\'t so obscenely fishy...   \\n\\nhash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\\n\\nstamm house = fail\\n\\nfood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\\nservice: 4.5 stars \\nvalue: 3 stars\\n\\n\\nsummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.',\n",
       " u'let me start right out by saying that this review has nothing to do with  food!!!  (unless you count the onion rings appetizer which tasted like most deep-fried onion ring appetizers.)\\n\\nsome of you know me now as someone who loves tradition and history and preservation and stuff-like-that.  \\n\\nso we came here for the tradition (great old supper club from the 40\\'s), the history (an1847 stagecoach inn, later a stop on the underground railway, and a speakeasy circa prohibition) and the preservation (it\\'s hard to keep a 150-year old lady going in style).\\n\\nso we came to drink and play, in other words, on a busy friday night, in spite of, or because of, the fish fry.  we grabbed some stools but found ourselves giving up our seats to some lovely ladies who were waiting to be seated for the fish fry.  (like i said, we weren\\'t here for the food, but i gotta wonder why the fish fry was jam packed constantly.)\\n\\nafter bugging the extremely convivial bartender about the history of the place, and begging to see the \"wine cellar\"/slave-holding-tank in the basement, he tossed his apron at someone and announced an impromptu \"tour\".  wow!\\n\\nit was cool to say the least, imagining the terrified slaves packed into the \"secret\" cellar, with its curved brick walls.  so we took turns squeezing in and out, then returned to the bar and proceeded to enjoy tons of conversation with the locals.  so, i\\'m a fan!',\n",
       " u'overall it was a nice supper club.  you have the bar area then you go upstairs to eat.  drinks were good.\\nthe fish was good.  i would have liked to see a baked option on the fish fry.  the family style all you can eat was good.  french fries were good too (all you can eat).\\nnot the best fish i have ever had, but above average.  the place was quite so you could talk without yelling which was nice.',\n",

       " u'sloppy joe was pretty bland. i had the spicy chili, good flavor. fries were good. def will go back and try burgers there.',\n",
       " u\"after the hype about their burgers i was really looking forward to trying the food here. \\n\\nthe meh: the hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent, but nothing extraordinary. edible. no honey offered with them though.\\n\\nthe ugh: with the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. they aren't. the burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from sysco. the reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette. normally i would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people....needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book. \\n\\ni can't say that i would visit again. there are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place.\\n\\nupdate: i've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that i ended up with frozen patties the time i was there. apparently they have a machine there that they make their patties with. i'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate.\",\n",
       " u'a total dive but the burgers are seriously amazing. bar tenders were friendly and the beer (limited) was cheap.',\n",

       " u'great food. friendly staff. no complaints.',\n",
       " u\"as many yelpers have said perfectly...the village green is the idealistic neighborhood tap.  i hadn't been in over 10 years, and walking back in the place looked exactly the same.  some would call it a bad thing, but i find it endearing.  we've been back a few times now and love going with friends for a casual friday night.  great specials (love the friday fish...but be prepared to eat only fried food).  my all-time favorite is their summer sausage reuben...if you love reubens you cannot go wrong with this jewel!  fries are always hot and fresh and service is always friendly.  one of middleton's best kept local secrets!\",\n",
       " u'want a burger?  go here!  price is a little on the high side for some of their dishes, but if your looking for a casual place to grab a beer and burger, this is the place.',\n",
       " u'a bit awkward. kind of like the snack bar at a summer camp. very nice people in there and the drinks were good. decor was lacking, but i cant fault it much for that.',\n",
       " u\"hard to pass up the road kill burrito.  ask for the bucket of sauces.\\nit was as good as when i tried it ten years ago as it was last week.\\ni don't think much has changed around here in 30 years, but that is definitely part of the charm.  i have heard the fish fry is good, but i have never been there on a friday night.  \\nlunch crowd has a lot of regular guys, quick and friendly service, prompt and hot food.  \\ndon't go looking for the lobster.  go for the specials, burgers, beer or the burrito!\",\n",
       " u'i love the small town bar feel. good food, nice tap selection. very comfy.',\n",
       " u'\"the green\" has the best burgers in the madison area.  it\\'s simple bar food, but done perfectly.  they know what they are doing here and they are doing it good.  the nachos are pretty awesome too.  they deep fry tortillas for the chips.  if you can, get a spot at the bar.  it\\'s good times.  \\n\\ni don\\'t eat fish, but some of my friends and my girlfriend do, and they like the fish fry on fridays.  i\\'ll stick to my cheeseburger.',\n",
       " u\"the village green is a wisconsin bar with packer memorabilia, formica tables and mismatched chairs, and better than average food.  it wasn't the best burger i've ever had and the fries and mushrooms were frozen.  the corned beef sandwich was fresh but not fantastic.   but it was adequate and i'd return if i had a hankering for wi bar food.  \\ni felt like i'd been here before the minute i walked in - the menu and atmosphere were indistinguishable from other taverns i'd been to.  their tap beer selection was good and its obvious they do a lot of business.  if this is what you are looking for, they do it well!\",\n",
       " u\"excellent friday fish fry!  their beer batter fish is crisp,tasty, and not at all greasy.  the hush puppies were equally good, but the fries could use some work. our waiter had a great personality and not only provided good service, but interesting trivia such as the fact that our meal had been prepared by steve miller's son (of the steve miller band fame).  \\n  reasonable prices, nice-sized portions, good service, and really good food--we'll be back!\",\n",
       " u\"this place is awesome for what it is, a very friendly, neighborhood tavern.  the food is mostly fried and greasy but served with a little slice of love.  the specials are excellent and the value is top notch.  want to watch a game?  they have a few big tv's and are very accommodating.  \\n\\nif you are looking for high-end, posh dinning, this isn't your place.  madison has plenty of excellent choices in that department.  this place is homey and will serve you a solid burger and fries, with a starter of wings and variety of homemade soups for a pretty good price.  come in and see these guys, they do it right.\",\n",

       " u'as others have already stated, i am rating this for what it is...a bar and grill, not a fancy 5-diamond restaurant.\\n\\ni chose the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and some french fries; absolutely delicious!  the burger is juicy and tasty...i add some ketchup and mustard for good measure!  i sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service.  the bartender is quick and attentive; the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd.  i also ordered a capital winter on tap and it was poured perfectly!\\n\\ni have been in the area for three years and i consistently return to the village green as the best burger in the area.  i like the simplicity of the burger and bun.  the meat is delicious and the bacon adds that extra umph!!!!  also they have nightly specials and i try to target tuesday (sloppy joes) and thursday (road kill burrito)...both are great!\\n\\nquick, consistent service, very tasty food and a friendly atmosphere; you cannot go wrong.',\n",
       " u\"i've been told they are known for their burgers, but their menu hosts a smattering of great bar foods. chicken wings, chili, seafood gumbo, fish, chicken in many forms, salads, and even some kids menu options.  i decided to try their cheese curds (great!) and the friday fish fry.  the hush puppies were too dry.  i'd recommend staying away from those.  the fish was good, but the next visit will be their burger.\",\n",
       " u\"if you're looking for a super fancy place, keep looking...this is your typical neighborhood tavern and it made me feel like i was back home in the milwaukee area.  the best burgers in madison...hands down!  good fries and cheese curds too...they had a number of other dishes that sounded yummy too.  super friendly staff.  we will definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u'the village green, i call it the vg for very good. if you want a good greasy burger, crispy golden fries, non-greasy crunchy cheese curds, a nice selection of local brews on tap and fast friendly service this place is for you.',\n",
       " u'i work near this walgreens and often find myself dropping-in to grab a quick water, soda, or bottle of meds (tylenol, advil, etc).  the location is clean and well lit, which is a plus.\\n\\nthe downsides:\\n- all walgreens are pricey\\n- slow checkout process, despite having 4+ available registers/lanes\\n- the intersection of junction/old sauk is a pain to get in and out of\\n- new \"rewards system\" stinks\\n\\nallow me to expand on the last \"downsides\" item... \\n\\nwalgreens initiated a rewards system that allows you to earn points from purchases that can then be applied to \"cash back\" rewards that can be used against future purchases.  \\n\\nwhere this fails is with the posted specials.  you can\\'t take advantage of the specials (like buy one, get one free) unless you\\'re a rewards system member.  i\\'m not a fan of that... i have about 800-billion rewards programs that i have to keep track of (and that keep track of me); the last thing i need is another rewards program.  i miss the good \\'ole days when walgreens used to offer bargains without the strings.\\n\\ni think i\\'m done visiting walgreens.  it\\'s convenient, but the cons outweigh the pros.',\n",
       " u'totally agree with steve l comments in his prior review,especially the rewards card usage to get specials. a real pain! i would also add that check out personnel were not the friendliest.',\n",
       " u'i visit this walgreens often since i work in the neighborhood. the employees are always very polite and helpful especially the 2 gentlemen and young woman who work the registers during the evening hours.  (i wish i could remember their names).  get signed up for their rewards program....there are great deals to be had!',\n",
       " u'a walgreen\\'s is a walgreen\\'s. this one seemed to be well stocked, clean, and staff was nice and helpful (mostly dealt with pharmacy staff). the rewards program is a little pointless to me, but it is easy enough to punch in your phone number while checking out. i don\\'t bother trying to use the actual rewards card. having the \"walgreen\\'s\" off brand items definitely helps you save a little money.',\n",
       " u'my favorite madison clothing store by far.  i coveted a pair of gold shoes they had over christmas ($135!)  and managed to save enough to buy them....totally worth it!!  they are italian leather and so beautiful.  everything else in the store is the same way....it makes me wish i had unlimited funds and could get one of everything.  the guys clothing is fantastic too, although getting your boyfriend to shell out that kind of money to look \"metrosexual\" is sometimes a challenge. something nice to keep in mind as well is that they have free alterations on non-sale clothing....i had a pair of jeans done and they actually put the detailing around the bottom back on....amazing!  5 stars.',\n",
       " u\"my experiences in this store have not been good for some years now.  gap, banana, and old navy used to make affordable and quality clothing, but in the past few years, the prices have increased and the quality has gone to shit.  clothes i have bought have had their hems fall out after one wearing and their buttons fall off quite easily.  not only is the quality bad, but the service is horrendous.  last time i was in the store, a worker said hi to me, but after looking around for a while, never checked in with me, and when i needed a fitting room they were locked and i had to wait almost 10 minutes to get the gals attention to let me in.  \\nthe last pair of shoes i bought there were quite comfortable, but within the first 30 minutes of wear, the heel feel off completely.  if you are looking for work attire/dress clothes, i would recommend passing on banana republic and trying your luck at macy's or another retailer.\",\n",
       " u\"when you hear banana republic you think quality clothing store?  at least that's what i think.  however, br in the mall is a shotty example for quality.  they are anything but quality.  the clothing in the entire gap inc. company has declined in quality over the years.  the service, unforutnatly, has also diminished.  the workers at br, i find, are unfriendly, unpersonable, and not ever around.  getting a fitting room in that place is a disaster.  i always have to wait for someone to be done using one, so i get to one that is opened.  nobody is ever back to there to unlock the doors.  i had a problem once with an associate, or who i thought was an associate, and asked to see the manager.  well, she was the manager.  totally unacceptable for a store with such clout.  i don't know if all banana republics operate this way, but if they do, they will most certainly be losing my business.\",\n",
       " u\"i feel like i should preface this review by saying that my current resolution to eat better (mainly starving myself until i fall asleep) has nothing to do with recent, shall we say less than positive reviews for businesses in madison. even if i wasn't hungry all the time, i'd still say this store blows and here's why. \\n\\n1. nobody greets you when you walk in. (customer service 101).\\n2. you can walk around for 15 minutes with an armful of clothing and nobody will ask you if you need a fitting room. (customer service 101 & loss prevention 101).\\n3. nobody will come by the fitting room to see how you're doing and if you need alternate sizes. (customer service 101, loss prevention 101 & sales 101). \\n\\ni've been three times and each time sucked more than the time before. (grammar 101). i started as a gap inc. employee in 1996 working my way up from gap baby to gap kids, gap and finally banana republic in 2009. i worked as a sales associate, a visual specialist and most recently men's merchant in arizona. the three times i've been here the store has always been in disarray which certainly doesn't create for a very stimulating shopping experience and the uninterested staff have made it so i'll simply only shop online now. \\n\\nsorry br, you're store's bananas and you've lost me.\",\n",
       " u\"i love banana republic... i love this location... i love it. every time i am in here (which seems to be every week) i seem to find something. now, i will say that this location does seem to be understaffed most of the time so i will agree with corey on the matter that it takes a while before you can talk to someone. however, i feel that once you find someone they are extremely helpful, at least in my experiences. they are always willing to find you the size you need and haven't taken too long to grab shoes or anything from the back.\\n\\ni will say over the holiday season they are a bit better but that is to be expected. finally, it can get a little messy in here when it is busy but again they seem to be understaffed which i feel for. i have actually seen one person consistently working here for about 2 years now and it seems like they never get a day off. so i think it is more a matter of staffing by the store owner or head manager. we'll see what the future brings for them but until then i will continue to shop here!\",\n",
       " u\"disgusting. \\nthat's the only word that comes to mind after walking front of store to back and seeing piles upon piles of clothing and items askew on every table, shelf and rack. i'd understand if it was 7pm on a saturday (weekend) but this was monday morning y'all, and the place looked like the pits! what the heck br? you are a mess! an absolute mess. and you're consistently a mess. \\ni walked in today with the intent to buy a suit (40% your entire purchase... sign up for their emails) but i couldn't even shop the racks with crammed half on hangers, half off hangars pants and jackets. this place needs an iron fist. a store manager who can shape this thing up and restore brs name as a gap inc brand. someone would have to tell me they did a complete 180 for me to return.\",\n",
       " u\"don't hate me corey...\\n\\nventured-in to look for a sweater or two; wednesday afternoon around 2:00pm.\\n\\n+ store was nearly empty, save for a few employees\\n+ things were tidy and neat; very easy to browse through things\\n+ staff left me alone (i hate being hounded while shopping)\\n+ staff was available when i had a question\\n+ 30% off all men's items\\n\\n- pushed a bit hard to get me to sign-up for their club and card. grrr. no means no?\\n\\ni think they took heed of corey's review and comments. the store & inventory was in great shape.\",\n",
       " u'this past weekend i was visiting madison for a conference and ate at the nitty gritty with a group of 50 people. the service was outstanding, friendly, attentive and quick. my water glass was never empty. the restaurant has two levels with high ceilings and polished wood floors. a relaxed, clean atmosphere.\\n\\nmy table of 5 started with chicken strips, good and standard and spinach dip. the spinach dip is excellent, extra cheesy and hot served with chips, and fresh veggies- carrots, celery, broccoli and cauliflower.\\n\\nwe all had burgers and fries. the burger was enormous i could only eat 1/2. pretty good deal for around $6.\\n\\nif you are in the area i recommend  the nitty gritty.',\n",
       " u\"a fun place to go for your birthday!  the wait staff is very friendly, easy-going, and kept checking on us.  we had the garlic burger and the teriyaki burger...very yummy....fries and pub fries are recommended. nice to go for your birthday mug with unlimited beer/soda and the world's smallest ice cream sundae.  i'll definitely go every year.\",\n",
       " u'my first fish fry!  yum.  and they make arnold palmers too!',\n",
       " u'watched the packers here. popular place for birthdays. good food too... seemed like a draft of smoke came in when the door opened which was annoying... but overall a great environment.',\n",
       " u\"maybe i missed something about this place, but after three tries, i just had to stop going back hoping i would finally feel the magic. the burgers are okay, but there are better ones in madison. \\n\\nthe last time we were there, my son's chicken sandwich was overcooked, and they charged more money since he got it on a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun. our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist. the buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them. and the last night we were there, a friday at about 6:00, the place was full and the service was terrible. as in waiting over fifteen minutes after i had piled all the dirty dishes at the end of the table as a hint that we were way done before the server came by wondering if we wanted anything else. \\n\\nand somehow, with four people, no alcoholic drinks, two appetizers, and four sandwiches, our bill was over $70. that's us dollars. before the tip. they charge extra for everything - ranch on the side, cheese on a burger - everything. for a really marginal meal and lousy service, that was way too much money.\",\n",
       " u\"you know i hate to do this but i have to agree with vickey m.  the gritty burgers are something of an acquired taste.  they taste good to me because they bring back memories of the 70s.   they do have good flavor but are somewhat messy and there are better burgers than the gritty.   \\nthe bar was more fun when it was small.  we don't go there anymore because often it is so busy that we can't really enjoy the place like we used to.\\nbut i would stop by again for the gritty burger.\\n\\ni recently learned that the gritty burger recipe was changed in the 80s sometime?   correct me if i'm wrong.   we did think the burger was somewhat different from what we remember.  now we know why.  the old burger that everyone loved was way better than the new one.\\nwe think they need to enlarge the place and bring back the original burger if they still have the recipe.   the sauce was the bomb.\",\n",
       " u\"tonight the fam got nitty gritty takeout, and for me it was a disappointment. i had suggested the ng because i'd been craving chicken tenders all day. in the past, ng's chicken appeared to be hand-breaded and had a decent dose of pepper in the breading to give it some flavor. tonight's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips. flat, factory-breaded, flavorless, and all of them with that gross gooey translucent strip of whatever you get in cheap chicken. making it worse was the addition of soggy fries and not-as-good-as-i-remembered gritty sauce. for almost $10, i'm calling this a total bust. yet another restaurant i can cross off the list for upping price and cutting quality.\",\n",
       " u'this nitty gritty i would have to say is not as good as the downtown madison one and the sole reason is that it is way too small for how many people generally go there. also their dartboard and such is not well placed and becomes a nuisance when trying to return to the bar for another drink. they have good drink specials and its still got that classic nitty atmosphere but not great...',\n",
       " u\"i was in town for training at epic. wanted a bar with good food to watch baseball playoffs. i remembered the nitty gritty near campus from a previous visit, so tried the one in middleton close to my hotel.\\n\\nbbq pulled pork sandwich - outstanding!\\nwaffle fries - excellent\\ncapital amber draft - very good\\natmosphere - fun\\nservice - great.\\n\\ntoo bad it wasn't my birthday.\\n\\nit seemed that everyone there had a birthday celebration in the group.  that's their thing.  i'll go back, even if it's not my birthday.\",\n",
       " u'their prices have gone up.  the quality has gone down.  medium-well burger was well done (crispy, burnt).  23 bucks for one gritty burger, one small cheese curd order and two draft beers.  wow, times have changed.  they just lost my future business.  judging by how few people were there, it looks like they may be losing a lot of business.  such a shame, because it used to be fantastic.',\n",
       " u\"meh. this place doesn't suck, but it's not very good. the only time you should really go is if it's your birthday so you can have free beer.\\n\\ntheir menu is incredibly boring and extremely overpriced for the quality of ingredients that they use. on my most recent visit, our table got an order of nachos to share. with chicken, it cost $12.50. it was nothing more than a plate of tortilla chips covered in day-glo orange cheese, jalapeno slices, and gray (eww) dried out chicken pieces. i also had a burger as my entree, and the beef tasted a little funky, like it had been reheated in a microwave--almost metallic. my dining partner had a salad that she seemed to enjoy, but it's hard to mess up a simple green salad. sadly, i've been here more often than i'd like to admit because they host team trivia on tuesday nights. my boyfriend and i decided to start going somewhere else for trivia when we recently won and got a $40 gift certificate and weren't excited to use it because it meant we'd have to try to consume more of their crappy food. we spent it mostly on booze instead.\",\n",

       " u'the food here is pretty much just like every other culver\\'s that i\\'ve ever been to.  it\\'s a chain, it has to be that way, so i don\\'t really care.  the cheese curds are good in theory but their deep-fried heavenliness will vanquish your appetite pretty quickly, and then you won\\'t be able to enjoy your greasy, cheesy, mayo-ey burger.  venturing away from the french fries is generally not a good idea.\\n\\nthe pork tenderloin sandwich is godlike.  the tenderloin is about twice as big as the bun that it\\'s served on.  i feel like this is my own little secret since i\\'ve never seen anybody else ordering or eating it.  now the cat is out of the bag.\\n\\nthis place recently did a renovation with a bunch of fake stone veneers and trendy curvy decor all over the place.  not bad, but i preferred the previous \"nursing home meets mcdonalds\" vibe they had going.  they did manage to improve the layout slightly so that the soda dispenser is no longer right in the way of where people are waiting for their to-go orders.  it still gets pretty nuts at lunchtime though, so prepare to drive around the parking lot a few times looking for a place.\\n\\none personal complaint i have with this place is i keep seeing old high school classmates working there.  i pretend not to recognize them.',\n",
       " u'i don\\'t get it? i don\\'t understand the fascination with culvers? the food costs twice that of wend\\'s, mc d\\'s, hardys, or burger king, and with the doubling of the price it has double of the grease! they figured if you \"butter toast\" the buns you can serve stale bread and know one will know. if you order through the drive through you will be given a number and have to wait. worst yet if you order a sundae you will get it first while you wait 15-20 minutes for you order to cook. just in time for you to enjoy you sundae as soup. worst yet it is not ice cream it is \"custard\". a frank\\'en food knock off of real ice cream. oh, and the fry\\'s are soggy. i don\\'t get it. amongst my friend i\\'m apparently the only one that doesn\\'t like this place?',\n",
       " u\"i love culver's. this is fact.\\n\\nthe thing that makes this culver's different from the rest is that they had offered wisconsin-fare, i.e. wisconsin cheese soup. wow, was this fantastic! the facility was clean, the employees were very happy and the food was very tasty!\\n\\ni'm glad that i can find quality fast-food, yet sit-down food across the nation!\",\n",
       " u\"this is the best culver's around because it is company owned (not franchised) and they use this store for training new managers, so everyone really knows their job and they are not miserable like most fast food employees.  and the food is almost always perfect.\",\n",
       " u'this place is the bomb.   fresh burgers and the cheese curds are melt in your mouth perfect.   the service is way above average and the restaurant is very clean.   i have enjoyed culvers for years when we would visit on vacation.   now we live here and we make a weekly visit to culvers for dinner.   of course you have to top the meal off with a custard.   it is a fast food restaurant but it is way above what you would expect from a fast food restaurant.',\n",
       " u\"affordable, fast, and yummy! \\n\\nloved their deluxe burger and chocolate frozen custard! \\nchoco frozen custard was soo smooth and creamy--you won't be able to look at ice cream the same! \\n\\np.s. their cheese curds are pretty good too!\",\n",
       " u'as the previous reviewer mentioned, this is a newly remodeled facility which has turned out wonderfully. all new equipment and works great. \\n\\ni have been using this place since i discovered it about a year ago. the remodeling took place in november and december 2012. previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. the remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the madison area. \\n\\ni have been there mostly on sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. personally, i believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). for 5 dollars i believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. the soap is not watered down like other places. they also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. the only other self service i know of in the madison area is off rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is much more watered down. \\n\\ni have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. they have a special going on in march that all dryers are free! all new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. in addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. i believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. they also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. it is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. i had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\\n\\ni have not used the dog wash, as i do not have a dog, but i imagine it could be something fun to do.\\n\\nthe only negative i have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot. its about as narrow as one lane, and people come in and out of same drag.',\n",
       " u'1. they moved, and their website still shows the old address.  the new location is \"hidden\" behind a larger building, and to get into the salon, you have to enter in through an \"outer\" building; it\\'s a suite inside of a building. didn\\'t matter much since they were closed by the time i found the place.\\n\\n2. they were closed by 4:50pm, and they don\\'t have their hours posted anywhere at their new location. i\\'d refer to their website for info, but it\\'s apparently out of date.\\n\\ni love aveda products; i will apparently have to go elsewhere to buy them.',\n",
       " u\"i recently had a pedicure after purchasing a groupon. the salon is very nice inside however the smell of perm products is very overwhelming. i would say it's the only negative. my pedicure was very lovely. i would go back in the future.\",\n",
       " u'i bought a groupon for a half price reflexology pedicure.\\n\\nthis is an aveda salon, so if you like their products you at least have that going for you. the salon isn\\'t the easiest to find- it\\'s a plain storefront in a strip mall. pedicures are done in a small room in back. there are two chairs and they bring a bowl of water for your feet. it\\'s not bad, but it\\'s right by the salon\\'s back room so you can hear employees talking on their breaks. it\\'s not the most well-ventilated room either, so it\\'s a bit warm.\\n\\nwhat i was expecting was something more than a regular pedicure, since with was supposed to be a \"reflexology\" pedicure. what i got what less that what most basic nail places do- no scrubbing, exfoliation, or even light massage.  they put aveda lotion on my legs at the end and lightly worked on my nails and cuticles before putting on polish.\\n\\nthey didn\\'t even use a basecoat or topcoat on my nails, which is really strange for a salon! i would never pay full price for even a regular pedicure here. they have a very small polish selection as well.',\n",
       " u'simple, relaxing surroundings for a good pedicure.',\n",
       " u\"for a salon with a name as refreshing as tangles salon, this business sure has a its goldilocks well....tangled. although this location carries the aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. there are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\\n\\ntangles salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. one begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\\n\\nafter a devastating fire destroyed tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\\n\\na receptionist named deeon, was at the front desk when i last entered tangles. he welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. he seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. i waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room i was unfortunate enough to have been next to. as i was waiting, i noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. there were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\\n\\non the plus side, tangles does have some talented stylists. but without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\\n\\ni wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. it is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. however, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.\",\n",
       " u'i recently purchased a group on for a salon pedicure and called to make the appointment which they were booked two weeks out.  i made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that i was scheduled with called in sick.  when i stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  ok, i was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   i indicated that i would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  i called back 10 minutes later to let them know that i could not make 3:00 work due an appointment i had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  this was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  i did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and i left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   i did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  i took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on whitney way which is a good 20 minute drive and when i arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   at this point i was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. the receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    this took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though i told them i would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      this is the poorest customer service i have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   i wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  i understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   also when a salon signs up to offer a group on deal, i would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   if they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.     not a new client!',\n",
       " u'aveda salons, in my opinion, have a reputation of being soothing, presentable and tasteful.  unfortunately, tangles salon lacked all three of those attributes.  i\\'d been to the former tangles locations for pedicures a handful of times and decided to visit their new location when a living social coupon was recently offered.  i received a shellac manicure, partial highlight and conditioning treatment and based on what i spent on the living social coupon i am satisfied with the results, but if i had paid full price for these services i would be very dissatisfied.  \\n\\nthere was just something \"off\" about my entire experience at tangles.  the salon and nail room looked messy and unorganized, as did most of the hair stylists and nail technicians.  i didn\\'t get that \"aveda vibe\" at all, more like the \"cost cutters vibe\" (nothing against cc, but if i\\'m paying $75 for highlights i\\'d like the atmosphere to match the price).  next time i\\'ll resist the lure of a good deal and go elsewhere.',\n",
       " u\"the best italian food in town, hands down.  they've got homemade sausage that's the best i've ever had, and they use fresh basil like there's no tomorrow.  my girlfriend's favorite is the pasta with giant prawns and pancetta.   this place is too good for madison.\",\n",
       " u\"i always crave vin santo, even though i haven't been there for years, i still have family back in middleton, and every time we visit, we have a feast! i truly believe it offers some of the best home made italian food in the midwest. a real hidden gem. and considering multiple family members have worked there in the past, we know what a tight ship is run, and how genuine the owners are in their hospitality and insistence for high quality in everything they do. please give it a try, and do not pass on the breadpudding/tiramisu for dessert : ) be warned that it may ruin you for life on anyone else's recipe!\",\n",
       " u\"vin santo rules!  \\n\\nthis is a great casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local couple.  she can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen.  their passion is reflected in the quality of their food and the high level of service provided to their guests.\\n\\ntheir food is some of the best in the area - they focus on northern italian cusine.  it's simple, fresh, and delicious!  they always offer a variety of specials.  \\n\\nthe portions are huge!  you definitely feel like you are getting your money's worth.  i have never left without leftovers.  \\n\\nmy favorite dish is the scampi gabriella (jumbo shrimp sauteed with garlic, pancetta, and scallions finished with a white wine cream sauce served over linguini).  awesome!!\",\n",
       " u'this is easily the best italian food in the madison area.  i\\'ve never had a bad meal (or even a bad bite!) on a visit to vin santo.\\n\\nthe seafood fettucini is really heavy on the seafood (they\\'re not trying to stiff their customers!) and they basically serve bricks of incredible tiramisu.  everything tastes so fresh and home-made and they offer a much more interesting menu than most \"italian\" restaurants in madison.\\n\\ni\\'m so happy that this locally-owned business has found great success - they have lots of regulars (like i used to be!) who keep coming back for the delicious food, big servings, friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere.  vin santo is a must for me when i\\'m in the area.',\n",

       " u\"delicious!! huge portions of very authentic italian dishes.  all entrees, salads, apps and desserts can easily be shared.  very cozy and wonderful servers.  can't wait to go back!\",\n",
       " u'i\\'ve now eaten twice at vin santo.  both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  the music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  the wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  with all of these elements going for it, i have high expectations for the food.  although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when i\\'ve dined there.\\n\\ni have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  the bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than i expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  the tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  the fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  the mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don\\'t come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\\n\\ntwo of my companions ordered the ravioli al vin santo; both liked and finished the dish.  it is one of four vegetarian options (the fettucini alla putenesca does not list meat, but i\\'ve never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom i dined.  one companion ordered the insalata di caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  a fourth companion ordered the lasagna del giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  a fifth companion ordered the fettucini alla putenesca, of which i tried a bite.  the spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  my entree, the campenelli il diavolillo, was pretty awful.  the combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and italian sausage.  the sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  it clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  the shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  the pasta was fresh and tasty.  it was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  all portions were huge.\\n\\nthe desserts are delicious.  the tiramisu, which i sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  i tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  it seems unlikely that they started the evening\\'s service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  the bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\\n\\ni can\\'t say i\\'ll be back anytime soon.  i have to disagree with zenide r.\\'s assertion that it\\'s \"easily the best italian food in the madison area.\"  for the price, both lombardino\\'s and tutto pasta make better italian food, and i shall stick to those restaurants in the future.',\n",
       " u\"i went here for a friend's graduation dinner. the seating area was filled. we had reservations and they were right on time. the service and level of professionalism was great. the menu is vegan friendly with a few delicious options. i tried a friend's baked eggplant dish and it was by far the best eggplant course i've ever had. many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved it. i ordered the pesto and was disappointed. the homemade noodles were good but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil i was hoping for. despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. i would definitely recommend this establishment.\",\n",
       " u\"i went to vin santo with some work colleagues while in middleton for a conference, and it was terrific!  the restaurant is small, with dimmed lights, which makes for a cozy setting.  the hostess and waitress were very welcoming.\\n\\nwe arrived around 7:45 on a tuesday, and we were the only people in the restaurant, which seemed unusual, but maybe it was because it was a weekday?  anyway, i ordered the scampi carciofi, which consisted of shrimp, garlic, artichokes, olive oil, and cherry tomatoes served over spinach fettuccine.  the portion was huge, and the food was fresh and very tasty.  my colleagues had the eggplant parmigiana, which looked and smelled delicious, and a chicken dish that i can't remember the name of, but which also looked pretty good.  \\n\\ni'm not sure vin santo is the best place for a business dinner, but for a romantic date, it's perfect.  i will make sure to come back here whenever i am in the madison area, and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a hearty, delicious italian meal.\",\n",
       " u\"we fell into vin santo on a busy friday night before a recent marathon that the pic was running in.  despite the wait (45 minutes) the owner (a sweet and thoughtful english woman) made every effort to accommodate us and move us up the list, even asking other patrons if they minded waiting just a couple more minutes.  \\n\\nas for the food, none of us could complain about being short-changed...especially the pic who was carb-loading.  the plates were absolutely delicious and huge (i thoroughly enjoyed the salsiccia rossa--pasta with so much homemade italian sausage that i had to take it home without noodles!).  we all walked away thinking we couldn't have picked a better spot nor gotten a better deal.\\n\\nthe decor was very nice and clean and the staff as mentioned previously was very helpful.  we'll definitely be back.\",\n",

       " u\"we love vin santo and have gone there about every month or two for 3 years. small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner clarissa greets us like family when we walk in. her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting italian dishes. their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in la, nyc, philly, etc).\\n\\n there are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. the lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. if you are lucky enough to go on an italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. i had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. in fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. but that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \\n\\nwe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. get one if you have someone to share it with. recently they have added a couple of desserts, including a caramel cheesecake, which i hope i am not too full to try someday.\",\n",

       " u'great italian eatery. the atmosphere is homey and intimate. i had the spaghetti with pine nuts, olives, capers, and anchovies in homemade tomato sauce. this dish was alright. i liked the idea of adding pine nuts, but the olives and capers made it too salty for my tastes. i had some leftovers and they were definitely better the next day even if they were still a little salty. \\n\\ndefinitely get the tirimasu cake while there. it was wonderful. not too rich, but soaked in expresso and very flavorful. there is a mascarpone cheese based whip cream which is light and not too sweet that makes the cake amazing.',\n",

       " u'everything was baked fresh, so expect a little bit of a longer wait, but well worth it. very generous portions -- best plan would probably be to get salads and split an entree or plan to bring some home with you. i had the italian sausage lasagna, which was very very good.',\n",
       " u\"i would rate vin santo at 2.5 stars for food and 4 stars for service. i guess i'm used to great italian fare in san francisco, but the food at vin santo didnt quite cut it for me both times i've eaten here. the portions are large, but taste doesnt cut it for me.\",\n",
       " u\"outstanding! this was our first time here and it was great. the server was very nice and responsive (he could have known a little more about the wine selection, but that wasn't a big deal). the food was great, light sauces and tons of flavor. we will definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u\"this is my new favorite restaurant in the madison area.  everything that crossed our table from the fresh pastas to the delicious sauces was a treat.  the portions were generous and the prices reasonable.  the calamari in the appetizer was tender and delicious in a rich and spicy tomato/fennel sauce.  the puttanesca sauce was dense with olives and the whole cloves of roasted garlic were a real treat.  the bread pudding was very good, but for me was a little heavy on the cinnamon.  i think i'll go with the tiramisu next time.  our water was pleasant and attentive.  the atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic...  but i would rather see real candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights.\",\n",
       " u'get the bread pudding!!!\\n...this is a nice restaurant that is cramped and casually decorated. the food is the stand out. the front is run by one of the owners and her service is very brief as she seats you and quickly moves on to the next task. the waitresses do a great job with the specials and describing the menu. food is delivered in an acceptable amount of time. you can see the chef and the kitchen through the window between the kitchen and the dining room which is always fun. their red sauce has a bit of spicy heat to it. \\nmy wife and i really do like this place for its great food and for its character.',\n",
       " u\"average food, good service, poor ambience. if you want something a lot better and don't mind the extra bucks, go around the corner to louisianne's.\",\n",

       " u'i had an unbelievable experience yesterday. i went to vin santo hoping to order some food to go. upon brief greeting the owner informed us that they \"don\\'t do takeout on the weekend\". this is astonishing and something that has never happened to me before.  i am a foodie an have dined on 5 different continents, including michelin rated restaurants. shocked, we went to villa dolce where the owner was very accommodating to our take out request. the food was delicious and very reasonably priced. your loss vin santo. we are never coming back.',\n",
       " u\"all i ever want is to go to a restaurant and get a giant bowl of fresh pasta that is stuffed with seafood, and that's what i got! \\n\\nthey are super duper friendly here.  it is a nice restaurant, but not stuffy at all.  leave the tuxes at home boys. the atmosphere is more casual and quaint. the dishes are more rustic italian, rather than fancy schmansy italian. the bread pudding comes a little messy, but so good, the table will definitely fight for it.\\n\\nthere isn't much seating, so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time. you can even do it online, so that's cool. \\n\\nplus, the aroma is completely mouth watering.  can't wait to go back there. \\nneed. more. pasta.\",\n",

       " u'does not live up to a recent review in madison paper.  \\ncons: too pricey & ala carte.  the pasta dishes in range $15- $20. the entrees: $20 - 30. the decor needs fresh paint and new carpet  and the restroom slightly grotty. server forgot to put in some of our order.  my ravioli vin santo was lacking flavor.  need to serve parmesan cheese with the bread & oil.\\nplus: nice people.  good tuscan mushroom soup.\\nfor the tiny storefront, family restaurant it is priced too high which sets your expectations higher and does not live up to those expectations.  it would be fine for your corner italian joint for everyday meals if they offered a salad with the meal and cut their $$.',\n",
       " u\"unbelievably disappointed.  i'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  they were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, i was treated quite poorly.  mostly ignored during my meal, i had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  not once did anyone check on my meal (i would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.  \\ni did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that i felt my service was horrible.  maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.\\ni travel to madison wi frequently for work, and i can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me.\",\n",
       " u\"vin santo is a good, but small italian restaurant in middleton.\\n\\nthere's a larger selection of pastas at this place than most other italian restaurants in the area. but other than that, it seems like the standard italian. the lasagna is okay, but small. but most of the pasta dishes are legit and are served with good portions. service is kind of slow and i'd recommend getting a reservation on weekends.\\n\\nnonetheless, dessert is great. though expensive, their italian bread pudding and tiramisu are huge and tasty.\",\n",
       " u'i absolutely loved this little restaurant! its tucked away and has a very intimate atmosphere. the italian food tastes homemade and authentic.\\n\\nthis is a great place for a date but not for a family.',\n",
       " u\"the food is very good, but overpriced.\\n\\nmy wife's favorite dessert is bread pudding and i was told this place has the best bread pudding around, and it did not disappoint, it was excellent. the food was also very good. my wife ordered mushroom and onion ravioli and her dish was better than mine. i ordered a pasta dish with sauteed shrimp, spicy italian sausage and chicken. it was also excellent, but i thought it could've done without the chicken. i started with a caesar salad and it tasted really fishy. also, the portions are huge, if you're going with one other person, you could probably split everything.\\n\\nthe service was excellent, but the decor wasn't very appealing, and as other reviewers have mentioned, it's a very small space. i'd check it out, especially to try the bread putting, but it's not a must.\",\n",
       " u\"nice place.  like others said not really that impressive on the inside, the tables are really jammed in there.  i guess that ok if you don't mind you waitresses butt in your face and food when she is at the table next to you.  i ordered pasta with scallops, shrimp, mussels, and calamari with a slightly spicy tomato sauce.  it was ok.  the pasta was cooked perfect.  and again like others said, it really lacked salt.  the seafood was good lots of mussels could have used more shrimp and scallops and a lot less squid!  my wife had the special of giant homemade ravioli with a caramelized onion and portabello mushrooms in a balsamic sauce.  this was really tasty.  the bread pudding is amazing!  not pretty to look at but delicious!  the coffee is great too!  would give more stars if they used a little more salt and a few less tables.  i would have also liked to see a few more meat choices.  the menu is really mostly seafood and chicken.  a few sausage offerings but no other choices of meat.  a nice steak would do wonders.\",\n",
       " u\"with all of the italian restaurants in madison it's hard for me to give this place more than 3 stars. we started out with mussels that were served in a butter sauce. the mussels tasted a little bit fishy for my liking. for my main course i had veal tortellini. the better half had a shrimp pasta in a white cream sauce. her dish was far btter than mine. for desert we had bread pudding and tiramisu. both were excellent.  my biggest gripes about this place were the kitchen is super small, so it can take quite a while to get your food. also, they have very few options for kids.\",\n",
       " u\"beware: serving sizes are ginormous!\\n\\nwe did not know this^^ and over-ordered!! next time the bf and i are splitting a plate of pasta! \\ncalamari appetizer was so inexpensive and so much food! in fact i think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. this was the most delicious app i have had--so flavorful and so fresh! \\non top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense. we were seafood-ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. the sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)\",\n",

       " u'on rare occasions i am transported back to italy--either by the ambiance, the hospitality, or the flavors of a restaurant. tonight i have had that experience as a result of the hospitality and flavors of vin santo. i had the ravioli pasta special and it was wonderful. the decor is somewhat meh, but the food was great. the servers make the cocktails, which seemed odd. i will come back with each visit to madison...',\n",
       " u\"my wife and i ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy to accommodate our dogs.  it had excellent service.  the food was fantastic.  the plates we had were simple fare with exceptional ingredients.  the chef did a wonderful job mixing and balancing flavors.  even the bar tender nailed the bellini's. it is very reasonable priced by which i mean a good, long dinner (2 hours+) for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about $100.  it is worth it!  if just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to $50-$60.  this is a great place to dine!\",\n",
       " u'after looking around madison for a good and authentic italian place, vin santo has the potential.  the pasta is definitely fresh, and the tiramisu was very good.  downsides - i felt that the dishes could have used more finesse in the seasoning and flavor and less in the overall amount, they were tasty but did not just pop out at me.  for instance, the ravioli was great - good pasta and sauce, but the spinach stuffing was just bland.  nevertheless, i will go back - need to find out if some of those spicier dishes are truly spicy.',\n",
       " u\"this is one of my favorite restaurants in middleton. the hostess and servers are friendly, and the food is delicious. entrees are large and flavorful. salads are also large and fresh. salad is not included with an entree, but if you decide to add one to your order, i suggest splitting it. the salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks. \\n\\nfor an entree, i highly recommend the scampi diavalio. it's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. there are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick, but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste. \\n\\noverall, this is a wonderful local restaurant with a cozy, friendly atmosphere and great food. i highly recommend it.\",\n",
       " u\"i've walked past the soup factory numerous times on my way into barriques. i decided to finally stop in yesterday.\\n\\nnow, as you can guess, this place's focus is....soup. they do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold). i decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich. i really like it when i have the half sandwich option, so i don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup. \\n\\nthe stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at java cat! the sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing. it's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!\\n\\ni'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!\",\n",
       " u\"the soup wasn't bad, but the guy who was serving it was really creepy and totally ruined the entire experience. plus, they were out of my first and second choices even though they were supposed to be open for 2 more hours.\",\n",
       " u\"i didn't know what to expect from the soup factory, but i liked what i found! i visited around noon on a weekday and the place was hopping with what seemed to be a local business crowd. i ordered the cheesy caprese sandwich and loved it. i sampled some of the soups as well and all were good, but maybe not great. there are about 8 different varieties of soup to choose from each day, everything from different chilis to stews to bisques--you won't get bored. and a regular menu of salads and sandwiches is available. friendly, hard-working staff.\",\n",
       " u'i\\'ve gone here a few times to see bands. it\\'s alright. the bar is fairly large, and they have volleyball outside. i\\'ve never been impressed with the barstaff. not exactly running up to greet you and get your order, and the mixed drinks are always a bit off. i\\'ve never had any of the food, but i\\'ve heard it\\'s decent. i will go here again if there\\'s a band i want to see(because it\\'s only a few blocks from home), but you\\'ll never hear me say \"whadya say we go to the tavern for a night of fun?!?!\"',\n",
       " u\"the club tavern is an interesting bar. it has a wide range of crowd members from the youthful to the middle aged.  i've been to this bar on numerous occasions for volleyball, and hanging out. and for most times its been a pleasant experience. the drinks are fairly priced, there is a lot of space so you don't feel crowded and usually the music is fair. \\n\\nsome points of concern though arrive with smoking. when will they make it a state wide band to smoke in bars and restaurants.  the bartenders also seem a little snobby on occasion. \\n\\ni wouldn't say this is the bar to go if your looking to have a great night but if you want a fun/interesting night with some interesting characters make sure you visit.\",\n",

       " u'i want to like this place - i really, really do.  but it\\'s fairly rundown, the bar staff makes you feel as if you\\'re ruining their day by asking for a drink, the food is average, and the bathroom conjures memories of b-list horror movie finales.  \\n\\ni\\'ve spent a few afternoons here watching the game, and even while sitting at the bar and tipping well with every drink, service is lackluster at best.  i\\'ve had their breakfast and some of the lunch fare - meh, nothing spectacular by any means.\\n\\nvery much \"the working man\\'s bar,\" and i appreciate that aspect, but i can\\'t help but feel like i\\'m just a step away from getting jabbed with a broken bottle or otherwise needing a tetanus shot whenever i stop by the club tavern.  \\n\\nmiddleton has better bars - try the midtown pub or paul\\'s neighborhood bar for a more personable and less sketchy experience.',\n",

(note: if you drink it straight from the pitcher, it still counts as one beer) club tavern also offers a pretty good breakfast, and they have specials for the early birds. best bloody mary in town, (except mine of course, but i live 1000 miles away now...) happy  hour at the club was always my favorite. 75 cent pints of miller high life. not the world's greatest beer, but definitely affordable during happy hour. i always like to visit the club when i get back to town.\",\n",

       " u'quick review: family-run breakfast/lunch joint with your typical diner staples.  quaint and cozy, lots of comfort foods.  nothing spectacular, though the homemade breads are quite good.  a bit on the pricey side and can fill-up with people quickly, especially on the weekends.\\n\\ndetailed review:\\ni\\'ve lived near c\\'s for about a year now, and have never stopped-in to check it out.  folks at work gave mixed reviews - some raved about the place, others gave it a \"meh.\"  i run past it nearly every morning and they always seem to have a good-sized crowd, especially on saturdays and sundays, so i figured it had to be somewhat decent... with that, i treated myself to a breakfast this morning.\\n\\ni wandered in at around 9:30am on memorial day and was pleased to find plenty of seating.  the hostess offered me a table outside, which was a nice bonus - the weather was gorgeous, so i happily took the offer.  i also grabbed one of their complimentary/shared newspapers to read.\\n\\na waitress stopped by to ask for my drink order - i went with coffee - and to drop off a menu.  she came back a few minutes later with an acrylic coffee cup and a stainless coffee carafe.  she left to tend to another table; i needed some cream for the coffee... oh well, it was nice and i was happy to continue browsing the menu, sans cream for my coffee.\\n\\nbreakfast offerings were ordinary: eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, omelets, skillets, and a couple of extras, like eggs benedict, belgian waffles, and some homemade pastries (turnovers, donuts, muffins, cookies, etc).\\n\\nthe waitress stopped by to ask if i was ready to order - told her i decided on the \"hen\\'s nest\" which consisted of 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  i also ordered a pancake, and requested some cream for the coffee.  she apologized and immediately brought some half-n-half containers.  we were in business.  \\n\\nbefore leaving to take my order to the kitchen, she asked if i\\'d like anything in the hashbrowns.  i was pleased!  c\\'s has some specialty hashbrown items on the menu, but i didn\\'t want to order a huge plate of them... so, when the offer surfaced to add onions, peppers, tomatoes, etc to my potatoes, i jumped at the chance.\\n\\nfood came about 20 minutes later and looked tasty.  the pancake was a lot thinner than i had pictured, but it was quite tasty.  i found myself wishing i had ordered 2.  \\n\\nthe hen\\'s nest was just \"ok\" - the hashbrowns weren\\'t greasy and featured a nice, crispy char,  but the onions and peppers didn\\'t do much for flavor, oddly enough... i found the entire dish to be largely flavorless.  :-(  \\n\\nthe multigrain toast was very good - and was probably the star of the entire meal.  the waitress only stopped by once more - to drop off the check, which was a bit of a shocker as well... $12 for my modest breakfast - $5.99 for the hen\\'s nest, $0.89 for adding extras to the hashbrowns, $2.99 for one (1) pancake (!!!), $1.89 for coffee.\\n\\nservice = 2 stars (nothing great)\\nfood = 3 stars (average breakfast fare)\\nvalue = 1.5 stars (quite pricey for what it was)\\nmisc = 3 stars (bakery items looked stellar, nice outdoor patio, very relaxing)\\n\\ni\\'d really like to give c\\'s 2.5 stars, but i\\'m feeling a bit generous so, it\\'s a 3-star \"gift\" rating.  had i been in a crankier mood, it would\\'ve gone 2-stars... :-)\\n\\nfor what it\\'s worth, i think the hubbard avenue diner has a better overall breakfast, and it\\'s about 1/2 the price.  it\\'ll probably be a while before i visit c\\'s again.',\n",

(this made me happy, as i like meat at breakfast after a night of rainy camping, but am allergic to pork.) the skillet had turkey, potatoes, onions and green peppers mixed together, with toast and 2 eggs on top. the eggs were perfect, which impressed me, given how crazy busy the place was. i do have one complaint about my food 'tho, the onions, peppers and potatoes were not cooked enough for my taste. in fact, the onions were damn near raw. luckily, they were finely shredded, so it wasn't too bad, but i take away a star for that .\\n\\n(bf says his potatoes were underdone too. not raw, but not quite done enough.)\\n\\nwaitstaff was very good about keeping coffee filled. and, since it was a bakery, we had to at least try a cinnamon roll.  it was a good roll, and they even warmed it up for us. \\n\\ni noticed that they had a lot of baked goods specializing with strawberry and rhubarb, which is in season right now. to me that's a good thing, even though i'm not big on rhubarb. tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \\n\\nit being father's day, they had a special on steak and eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too. dads got a huge complimentary chocolate-covered strawberry, which i thought was nice.   \\n\\noh yeah, the eggs with hollendaise sauce looked and smelled really good...\",\n",

       " u\"one of my favorite activities of the summer is to hit up the capital bier garten for a relaxing night with my friends and family.  i've never done the tour or hung out in the bier stube, though they're both on my list, but between memorial day and halloween i try to make my way over to terrace avenue as often as possible.  it's also become somewhat of a tradition amongst my friends to go to bockfest in february as well as wait in line for great taste tickets in may.  these are good times in their own regard, but the best times i've had here are just the random summer nights spent sitting at a picnic table with friends or watching a band playing on stage.  on weekend nights during the summer the place gets packed, especially if a band is playing.  and while it's pretty easy to find capital beers on tap or at stores throughout the area, nothing beats fresh from the brewery.  as an added bonus, you can often get the seasonals or other less prominent beers on tap here as opposed to the bottles prevalent elsewhere.  this past summer my go-to was the wild rice lager, as well as the supper club lager on the really hot nights.  there's even a few wine choices for the non-beer drinking crowd, including wollersheim's prairie fume.  \\n\\ni've got a decent history going on with the bier garten, as this was one of the places i went on my 21st birthday.  my buddy purchased me one of the half-liter plastic mugs as my birthday present.  i've still got it to this day, and i bring it with every time i go out.  suffice it to say, however much that mug cost has been more than offset by the reduced cost per ounce offered by the mug.  if you're planning on coming back i definitely recommend making the investment.  it beats the regular 16 oz plastic cups and i'd hazard a guess it's comparable to getting a pitcher, without the necessity of coming to agreement on what beer to order.\\n\\nthere isn't any food service whatsoever, but it's perfectly fine to bring in your own with you.  my personal go-to is gino's, but there's plenty of places nearby and i believe you can ask for take-out menus of local restaurants up at the counter.  i've even ordered falbo's for delivery pizza a couple times - just meet them outside the gate by road.  capital's also put up a large tent over most of the picnic tables, which helps when the weather is inclement.  mosquitoes are an issue, especially as the sun goes down, but this is wisconsin so you've got to expect that.  the place closes down at 9:00 pm in deference to the residential nature of the area, which actually is a blessing in many ways.  on weekends it's a great start to the evening, and i really don't need to be staying out that late on weeknights anymore.\",\n",
       " u'spent a saturday driving around to the breweries in the area, and this was hands down my favorite.  the atmosphere during the tour was super casual, the bar inside was full of friendly bartenders/tour guides. (bier garten was closed as it was practically winter.) this was my favorite tour because the guides actually describe the process of making beer and tastings were handed out rather copiously.',\n",
       " u\"went on a friday afternoon tour/tasting. started with a beer in a pint glass in the bar (you getto keep the glass). the tour guide was very casual and provided good info about the beer and brewing process. at various points along the way a woman would show up with pitchers of different types of beer and pour it in your glass if you wanted a taste. the pours were generous and by the end of the tour you have a nice little buzz going. the beer was very fresh and it all tatsted good. can't wait to go back over the summer to sit outside in the garden and listen to bands.\",\n",
       " u\"i've been drinking their beer for a few years but was only able to make the trip up to middleton to take the tour yesterday. tour was great- $3 gives you a 30 minute peek at their small facility with a personable and knowledgeable capital employee and a 5oz. souvenir glass. we had 4 beers on the tour- island wheat, supper club, maibock and amber. \\n\\noutside beer garden was great and the indoor bar was small but accommodating. gift shop was also small- sweatshirts, t-shirts, 6 packs and pint glasses for sale. i don't find my way out in these parts often but we had a great time and some fantastic beers.\",\n",
       " u'showed up for a tour, but they had already finished for the day. still one of the guys took us on a private tour. started off with a free beer, had the octoberfest. very good beer. the guy was very informative and showed us the whole place. answered some questions we had about beer also.',\n",
       " u\"i love the capital brewery because i think it encompasses everything that is quintessentially wisconsin. capital brewery makes consistently high-quality german lagers (with a few good ales thrown in for good measure), and provides a low-key, no-frills environment that can be whatever you want it to be. the beer garden (bier garten?) is huge, filled with weather-beaten picnic tables, and covered with a big awning to keep out the sun. trees insulate the place, and the whole thing is topped off with a nice stage for weekly summer performances by local staples such as westside andy and the mel ford band. people bring their kids, their dogs, decks of cards and board games, and enjoy the excellent beer that's doled out at the outdoor taps by friendly staff. bring your own food - some local joints like the roman candle will even deliver right to your picnic table. and if the weather's not so nice, you can visit the bier stube, capital's indoor bar, which is full of dark, rich wood and nice people. i highly recommend the capital brewery. and don't forget to take the short tour!\",\n",
       " u\"came here on a tour with a big group from meetup.  the tour guide was nice, and did his best to keep the group entertained and under control.  $5 for a tour, with a good amount of samples and a free glass.  if you're looking for something fun to do, i'd recommend it.\",\n",
       " u'good beer. fun atmosphere at outdoor beer garden. great people watching. especially on fridays in the summer.  blonde doppel bock is outstanding.',\n",
       " u\"how in the world did i forget/miss a review of the capital brewery?  crikey - i'm losing it, i tell 'ya.\\n\\nno visit to the madison area would be complete without stopping-by the capital brewery.  during the spring/summer/fall months, their beer garden is phenomenal.  it's a large, trellised, open area that's sun-protected compliments of a huge blue tent cover/awning.  \\n\\npicnic tables galore, it makes for an ideal location to chill with friends and family.  bring along whatever type of food you'd like, because they don't serve food here.  or, better yet, call one of the many local restaurants and request delivery - most of them service the brewery.  dogs are more than welcome, as are kids. \\n\\na large stage frames the eastern side of the garden; you'll find live music on most friday and saturday nights.  they used to show movies on saturday nights, but i believe that has come to pass.\\n\\nthe staff is always excellent.  you won't find a nicer group of folks no matter how far or hard you search.  kyle's the absolute best - the guy is unbelievably friendly, funny, and knows everything about the brews.  he often serves as the brewery tour guide, so pay attention if he suggests you try a certain brew.\\n\\nduring the colder months, the indoor stube is warm and inviting.  there's a large flat screen television for game watching, and plenty of comfy seating.  the stube operates on reduced hours during the winter months, and just a heads-up that it's often times rented/reserved for private events (think holiday parties), so check their website schedule prior to planning a spur-of-the-moment visit.\\n\\nthe gift shop is nice, with a great selection of glasses, shirts, and other goodies.  prices are more than reasonable.  the bathrooms are usually spotless, which is a bonus.\\n\\nso... if you haven't been to the brewery, make it a priority to visit.  stop by on a saturday or sunday and take the tour (it's only a couple of dollars, includes samples, and runs hourly), then spend time enjoying some of capital's great beers.  you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " u'had a chance to try autumnal fire and some other brews. autumnal fire was great, not exactly my kind of beer, but still tasty. would try more beers definitely.',\n",
       " u\"my mind is too often my enemy. too frequently, when thoughts of something 'inexplicable' or 'unpredictable' come to mind, they're most often associated with negative circumstances. an 'inexplicable' string of bad luck at the craps table. an 'unpredictable' severe weather pattern. it's human nature to associate things that we can't predict or control with the negative.\\n\\nbut once every blue moon, something inexplicable happens for the good. such was the case with me stumbling upon capital brewery in madison, wisconsin - a festive,  local beer haven surrounded by sprawling suburban retail strip malls and chain restaurants. \\n\\ni only had an hour to kill before a wedding, but that hour was filled with bonfires, live music,  locally crafted dopplebock and conversations with the most knowledgeable beer lovers i've ever met (they know the brooklyn brewery folks on a first name basis). \\n\\ni'm not sure if capital brewery is always this way, but on this day, it was inexplicably, unpredictably and unexpectedly welcome.\",\n",
       " u'finally went on their tour this saturday, which i actually felt obligated to do, considering how much of their product i ingest on a regular basis. \\n\\nour tour guide was very lively and fun, and knew a looooooot about the process of brewing beer. we also got a small drinking glass as part of our tour, and 3 beer bottle caps that can be traded in for a sample of anything on tap.\\n\\nyou can also trade in all 3 caps for a pint of a single beer, which i wish i had known about before i eagerly sampled my first beer. \\n\\nanywaaays, the tour was short and sweet, and the beer cold and refreshing. \\n\\na perfect break on a saturday afternoon.',\n",
       " u\"went for a tour of the brewery.\\n\\nthe tour guide was great, the brews were incredibly fresh and tasty, and we overall had the best experience of being a tourist in madison, wi here.\\n\\nthe beer garden aspect is tempting for a possible future return, but we'll see. look out for a potential future review, yelpers!\",\n",

       " u\"get out!\\n(no seriously... get out.)\\nnothing beats a brew in one of madison's best beer gardens. with a shady roof overhead (love that newer addition) and tables for you and an army of your friends, this is quickly becoming my fave locale for keeping hydrated.\",\n",
       " u\"love the outdoor area here. they have a good selection of beer and a giant outdoor bar area. they also have a great tasting room inside for when it's cold or rainy. \\n\\nthe brewery tour is short but interesting (it's not a huge place after all). their beers are decent, not the best in town, though. they offer seasonals and new brews on occasion.\\n\\nas far as beer is concerned, there's much better out there in madison. the outdoor space, however, is great.\",\n",
       " u\"went for the tour and drinking on a summer saturday. pretty nice little saturday! tour is $5 and they just take you through the warehouse and some of the brewing area. it isn't anything overly special. if you've been on other brewery tours before it is a pretty standard one.\\n\\nbeer i great though. with the $5 tour you get a small tasting glass and three different tastings. they have the staples along with more seasonal and experimental type brews. pretty reasonable prices too if you want beers/pitchers also (which you will). pitchers are generally around $11.\",\n",
       " u\"my favorite microbrew that i have ever been to.  having lived nearby for many years i frequented this place as my favorite in madison.  \\n\\nthe beer are all good with my favorites being the maibock and autumnal fire (eisphyre) if it is available. \\n\\nfor those that prefer lighter beers the amber or supper club are wonderful too.  \\n\\nthey don't sell food on site but numerous neighborhood restaurants in the area are available for delivery.  another option would be to use the grills on the patio which the brewery owns. \\n\\nlive music nights outside are worth a stop since they are free.  local bands/people play.\",\n",
       " u'capital is my go to friday night spot!\\n\\ni love visiting capital brewery anytime of year. the beer garden is a great place to enjoy a cold brew, sunshine and live music in the summer time. in the winter the bier stube is cozy and fun.\\n\\nthe staff is awesome and the beer is delicious. plus you can bring your own snacks!',\n",

       " u\"meh.  in my quest to visit every brewery in wisconsin, i had to stop at capital brewery.  i previously tried some of their beers at the mke brewfest and was semi-impressed by the new imperial ipas so i wanted to give some of their other beers a try.  i don't know if it's because we came on a day where there was a 5k or what, but the brewery was pretty much closed except for the beer garden and the little store inside.  there were no samples or flights offered and you could only get a pint for like $6 outside.  bah.  we wanted to try something new so we had an autumnal fire and the appleanche dopplebock.  we weren't impressed with either one.  frankly, the appleanche was just weird.  it smelled like an apple cider and tasted like an average ale.  the autumnal fire was decent but nothing special.  i totally committed alcohol abuse and threw half of my beer away.  *gasp* \\n\\nsadly so, i expected more from capital and don't think i'd stop back in next time i'm in madison when there are breweries like ale asylum nearby.\",\n",

       " u'i spent the better part of seven years of my life as an automotive technician at a fairly large (20+ techs) dealership, and as such fully and completely appreciate the expertise, knowledge, and service that a dealership provides.\\n\\nwhenever possible, i purchase parts and services from local dealerships.  yes, i could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, i respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \\n\\nthat said, this particular vw dealership (the zimbrick on century avenue is only a vw dealer, btw - no acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\\n\\ni called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my vw jetta.  my jetta has the 1.9l brm diesel motor (\"pd\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  vw mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the brm diesel motor.  failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\\n\\nso imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \"any old oil\" while on the phone.  when i tried to correct him and request the 505.01 castrol vw oil, he seemed to get a bit unnerved.\\n\\ni then asked about a fuel filter, and despite having told him the make, model, year, and engine type of my vw on three separate occasions, he still misquoted my filter.  i then gave him my vin, and he was still confused.  a few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what i would pay from any other online vw parts dealer.\\n\\nso, i declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.  i\\'m sorry, but my confidence was shaken immediately, and i was floored by the sky high price (they quoted $60 for the filter; everyone else is $25).',\n",

       " u\"i had mentioned in a separate review that, per the website, this pizza pit doesn't have mac-and-cheese pizza. well, i went to get some gyros (they have a mini greek restaurant inside, apparently, called athens) and saw on the board that they do have the mac/cheese pizza. i stand corrected. \\n\\non to the gyros. the actual greek restaurant in town is closed on mondays, so we came here for our fix. we got gyros only, no fries (there aren't a lot of options, that might be it right there). they come with tomatoes and onions - i requested mine without onions. \\n\\nthey were fine. not stellar, not terrible. i've had better ones at a lot of places, but considering that i only had to drive ten minutes to get these, they were good enough. \\n\\ni was told 15 minutes, and when i got there 15 minutes (or so) later they were ready to go but still warm once i got them home and started devouring.\",\n",

       " u\"we went here for a family christmas brunch last month. having lived in town for nearly 20 years, we had always seen but never actually been to sir hobo's. we had no idea what we were missing. when we first sat down, we were greated by a jolly waitress with a thick, possibly greek accent. her nametag said her name was gerestina, but her attitude said she loved her job. the complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite. and the meal only got better. but the biggest surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed. the cook came crashing out of the kitchen, carrying a cpr mask in one hand and a bloody meat cleaver in the other. through his quick action, the cook was able to resucitate the homeless man. as we all applauded, the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand. the homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great big bear hug. it seems that sir hobos still certainly cares for our fine city's hobo community.\",\n",

       " u\"how pleasantly surprised i was to find this old school greasy spoon ( and i say that as a compliment). this is the kind of place i remember fondly from my youth in nj.  no pretension, no gimmicks, just honest food done well.  i had one of the specials - an omelet with cilantro, chorizo, green and red peppers and onions.  it was perfect.  perhaps my favorite part about my breakfast was the hash brown potatoes. at many places like this, they are soggy and undercooked.  not only were they spiced well, but they were crispy as well.  that's no joke with breakfast potatoes!    in any case, i've been back twice in a week and a half, and plan on returning often.  don't let the exterior or decor fool you; they make good food in that tiny building.\",\n",
       " u\"i love local hometown eateries. so when we were looking for a place for lunch while on the road, the prairie diner called out to us. inside looks like a 50s diner with stainless steel lunch counter and cozy booths. judging by the area around it, it can be that old but at least it looks authentic.  the service was prompt and friendly, even the cook greeted us when we walked in the front door which appears to be the back door as you enter near the back of the kitchen and restrooms. the young cook even said thank you on our way out. i don't think i've ever seen that before, i figured he must be the owner.\\n\\nthe wife ordered the ultimate omelette, i had the perch lunch. they even had a perch breakfast on the menu that comes with eggs. only in wisconsin! the atmosphere and service made you feel right at home. the food was just average. we're not complaining, other things are as important as the food in a restaurant. much more memorable than a stop at mcdonald's next door.\",\n",

       " u\"the most family oriented work out place in town.  we love the indoor family and warm water pools. the nursery staff is excellent. i like that when we come in to drop the kids off at the nursery, they greet us by our first names.  i love the infrared sauna they recently put in. \\none advice i would give to people who are considering of joining is that you don't have to get the most exclusive membership like gold cove, if you are only going to work out on the machines. we have gold cove, the most expensive membership which allows you to have exclusive access to outdoor water park during summer and most of the group fitness classes offered in the club but we hardly go to group fitness class and hardly go to outdoor water park. the water temperature is still cold even it is 80 degrees out. this past summer, we went to the outdoor water park maybe two- three times the most and stayed out no more than half hour. so, it really isn't worth to have a gold cove unless you know you are looking for specific classes with gc membership. \\nthe parking and getting the machine to work out can be a problematic during winter months between 4:30-7:00pm. sometime, you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for the machine to free. if that's the case, you can go sit in the sauna until some people leave. so, i would suggest go there early in the morning or late in the evening but then if you are bringing along your little ones you run into problems with daycare after nursery is closed. they have a restaurant that offers supposedly healthier food but we never had any luck with the food there. the taste is okay and price is a little bit on the high end for the amount you get.\",\n",

       " u\"i was a member at this club for 5 years.  so i have a lot to say, but not nearly enough yelp space in which to do it, so i shall do my best to summarize.\\n\\npros\\n1. three indoor swimming pools + two jacuzzis\\n2. lots and lots of cardio equipment + 4 different weight areas\\n3. indoor soccer field, track, basketball courts, and racquetball courts\\n4. lots of classes - aerobics, swimming, spinning, etc\\n5. outdoor pools with waterpark\\n6. childcare\\n\\ncons\\n1. expensive membership with required 2 year contract\\n2. you only have access to all the things listed above under the pros section if you have the gold cove membership, which is the most expensive package.  regardless of having the most expensive membership, you still have to pay extra for most of the classes.  \\n3. if you have anything less than the gold cove membership, there is one older woman at the front desk, as you check in, who will look at you like you're trying to steal the tanning bed she lives in.  however, there is also a younger one with long, dark hair, who is more of an equal opportunity offender.  she'll treat you like crap, no matter what your status.\\n4. if you don't have gold cove forget about going to the waterpark, unless you want to pay 23 dollars per person to get in.  \\n5. do not, i repeat, do not bring in any of your own food.  if they catch you anywhere in the facility with so much as a pretzel stick, they will go off on you, thusly informing you that you can only consume food and beverages purchased at their lounge/bar/crappy food place.  because you know, you might be trying to smuggle in crack cocaine with your pretzels. \\n6. lounge/bar area serves you the crappiest, overpriced food you can find.  i don't know about the bar because i didn't go to a health club to drink.  \\n7. parking is a nightmare, especially in the mornings, and right around the time people are coming home from work.  while that is to be expected, the countless number of suvs and big pick ups with something to prove, stalking people as they head to their vehicles makes for a dangerously crowded, and highly annoying situation.\\n\\nthere you have it.  nice club, with nice amenities, just be prepared to part with your money, and deal with a few annoying aspects.\",\n",
       " u\"unsupervised kids!!  the signs tell parents to watch their kids, but i haven't been there once when there weren't children running about the cycle & elliptical machines playing tag or something.  most machines are par for the course.  some are a bit outdated.  they don't have personal tv's on each machine like some clubs, but they do have a group of tv's you can tune into while working out using your headset.  you can't go into the sauna unless you are wearing a swimsuit (not just a towel).  it's not the worst place i've ever seen; the environment just didn't really fit my expectations as a single, professional.\",\n",
       " u\"best gym in the area.\\n\\ni have been a member of 3 different gyms in the madison area and none have impressed me like prairie athletic club. the facilities are clean, staff is friendly and efficient, and they have great equipment!\\n\\ni love the different workout areas - there are several rooms with cardio and weights equipment so you can find your favorite spot, or rotate through them all of a change of scenery. there are several pools, both indoor and out, saunas in the locker rooms, and a hot tub.\\n\\nthe group fitness classes are offered at several times throughout the day, so it's easy to find a class & time that fit your schedule. classes are only included with the most expensive membership, but it is so worth it. the membership is very affordable, especially compared to other gyms that i've tried where you get much less for almost the same price.\",\n",

A query-document pair is represented by a 46-dimensional feature vector. Features are a numeric value describing a document and query such as TFIDF, BM25, Page Rank, ....
